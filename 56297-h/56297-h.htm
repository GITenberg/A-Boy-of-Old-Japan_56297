PREFACE</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">I am</span> under deep obligations to the publishers,
for giving me an opportunity to tell
the story of the rejuvenation of Japan.
I was a witness, although at that time I did not
comprehend the movement, but I, and those
few who are still living, do now.</p>

<p>From a federation of mutually autonomous
oligarchies, Japan was metamorphosed into an
Empire which holds Russia at bay. From a
nation occupying 150,000 square miles, it has
expanded by the addition of Formosa, and its
population has grown from thirty millions to
forty-five millions. An oriental people adopted
occidental progress, and within three decades or
little more than one generation, digested and assimilated
our progress.</p>

<p>I have known, and was personally known to
the men, whose story I have endeavored to tell.
They are now honored under the simple name
of Genrô,&mdash;statesmen of Revolutionary Times.
Of the brilliant array of patriots whose names
appear in these pages, only Ito, Inouye, and
OKuma remain!</p>

<p>I have kept the names. Why should I not?
Only honor can be bestowed upon such patriots
as they; and the world delights to honor them.
Besides, there is a healthy spirit for the young
in a <i>true</i> story of devotion, sacrifice, and self-restraint.
How often does a child, when reading
an interesting story, ask: &#8220;Papa, is this
true?&#8221; In this case the father may conscientiously
answer: It is.</p>

<p>All the characters as portrayed in these
pages, were living actors in the great national
drama. Of those whose names have never before
appeared in print, Karassu Maru, the only
<i>impulsive</i> noble I have ever known, was the
first imperial governor of Yedo. He died in
August, 1872, and I attended his funeral.
Honami came to Yedo with the emperor, but he
was soon sent back to Kyoto, where he was
placed under guardianship.</p>

<p>I have enjoyed the retrospective communication
with my old friends. If my readers do so,
they owe the pleasure to the publishers, who
suggested the composition of the book.</p>

JAPAN ASLEEP</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Japan</span> had been asleep for more than two
hundred years. About the time when
the Pilgrim fathers landed in what is
now known as the New England States, the
man who ruled over Japan had made up his
mind that he would have nothing more to do
with the people of Europe, and he gave orders
that no more foreigners should be admitted.
He made one exception in favor of the people
of Holland, but on condition that only a very
small number of them should reside in Japan
at a time; and they must be satisfied with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
tiny island of Deshima<a href="#A1">[1]</a> in the harbor of Nagasaki,<a href="#A2">[2]</a>
and promise that they would obey the
governor of that city.</p>

<p>It was not many years before this time, when
the Japanese had been glad to receive every
European, but they had found out that the Portuguese
and Spaniards wished to be masters of
their country, and so their kindness had
changed first into dislike and afterwards into
hate. The Portuguese had taught many Japanese
about our Lord, and a number of them
had become Christians. But the Shogun<a href="#A3">[3]</a> ordered
that all Christians must be killed, and
thousands of them were put to death. He gave
also orders that all large ships must be destroyed,
and that thereafter only small vessels
could be built. Besides, he threatened to put
to death any Japanese who should return to his
country after having been abroad, even if he
had been carried away against his will. No
foreigner could come to Japan and no Japanese
could leave his country. They could, therefore,
learn nothing from other people. That<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
is why I said that Japan had been asleep for
more than two hundred years.</p>

<p>In all that long time there had been no
change. Just as Japan was in 1621, so it was
in 1853. The houses were still built in exactly
the same way, the men and boys dressed exactly
as their ancestors had done before, and so
did the women and girls, and they lived in the
same manner.</p>

<p>The people worked hard from early in the
morning until late at night. The merchants,
mechanics, and farmers, toiled from the beginning
of the year to the end, without any Sundays
or holidays, except on New Year&#8217;s day,
and perhaps a few days later. They had nothing
to say in the government, and belonged to
the Lord on whose estate they were living. The
whole of Japan was divided into about three
hundred of such estates; some of them very
large and others again very small. Over each
of these estates was a daimiyo,<a href="#A4">[4]</a> or lord, who
was assisted by as many samurai,<a href="#A5">[5]</a> or knights,
as the estate could support. These knights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
were the civil officers of the estate while there
was peace; but as soon as war broke out they
were soldiers, always ready to go into battle,
and to die for their lord.</p>

<p>The greatest of all the daimiyo was the Shogun<a href="#A3">[3]</a>,
or Commander-in-chief, who resided in
his large castle at Yedo.<a href="#A6">[6]</a> It was he who made
the laws for all the Japanese, and he had so
many samurai that not even the greatest daimiyo
dared disobey him. But, although he had
as much power as any emperor, still he was not
the real Emperor of Japan. Many, many years
before there was any Shogun, the country had
been governed by the ancestors of a man who
was living quietly in Kyoto.<a href="#A7">[7]</a> His house was
shaped like a temple, and stood in the most
beautiful grounds that can be imagined. When
the people spoke of him, they whispered: Tenshi
Sama,<a href="#A8">[8]</a> for he was to them the Child of
Heaven, the descendant, as they thought, of
the gods who created Japan.</p>



<p>But Tenshi Sama, they believed, was too
mighty and too great to care about such a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
thing as governing the people. All he had to
do was to pray to the gods to take care of Japan,
and they would surely hear his prayers. Since
the first Shogun ruled over Japan, there had
been many wars and much bloodshed, because
many daimiyo wanted larger estates than they
possessed. All these wars ceased in the year
1600, when the Daimiyo of Tokugawa,<a href="#A9">[9]</a> named
Iyeyasu,<a href="#A10">[10]</a> defeated his rivals at Sekigahara,<a href="#A11">[11]</a>
and caused the Tenshi Sama to make him Shogun.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_004f.jpg" alt="PEACE REIGNED OVER THE COUNTRY" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;PEACE REIGNED OVER THE COUNTRY.&#8221;</p>

<p>Iyeyasu was such a brave general, and besides
an able as well as a generous man, that
the country began to enjoy peace. The great
daimiyo tried once more to shake off his rule,
but they could not do it. In 1615 the last battle
was fought, and the daimiyo were defeated
so badly that they gave in. Iyeyasu punished
some of them very severely. He took a very
large part of the estate of Lord Mori,<a href="#A12">[12]</a> the
Daimiyo of Choshiu,<a href="#A13">[13]</a> and divided it among
two of his sons. Mori henceforth was the enemy
of Tokugawa, and so were all the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
daimiyo who had suffered defeat. But Iyeyasu
ordered them to build yashiki,<a href="#A14">[14]</a> or mansions, in
Yedo, and to live there half of the year. Iyemitsu,<a href="#A15">[15]</a>
the grandson of Iyeyasu and the third
Tokugawa Shogun, commanded them to leave
their wives and children at Yedo, where he held
them in his power. He made laws for the people,
the samurai, and the daimiyo, and, since
he had an army of 80,000 samurai on his own
estates, he was strong enough to make the
daimiyo obey him.</p>

<p>Thus all war ceased in Japan and peace
reigned over the country. The merchant plied
his trade, the mechanic worked at his craft, and
the peasant toiled in his field, as their fathers
had done before them, and they brought up
their sons to do as they had been taught. There
was, therefore, no progress; and there was very
little liberty.</p>

<p>The only people who really did have something
to say, were the samurai or knights.
They did not work, but were paid by the daimiyo
whom they served. They were very proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
of being <i>gentlemen</i>, and never failed to speak
and act as they believed was right. Thus Japan
continued until the year 1853. Then a number
of &#8220;fire-ships,&#8221; their smoke stacks belching
forth a dense smoke, steamed up Yedo Bay.
The cliffs echoed the throbbing of the engines.
In vain did the Shogun&#8217;s guard boats warn
them to go back. They did not heed these
commands any more than when the tide turned,
and the current tried to stop their progress.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1"  class="fnanchor">[A]</a>
On, on they went toward the capital of the Shogun,
until the shoaling water warned them to
cast anchor. Their commander was notified
that he must leave, but he replied that he carried
a letter for the Shogun, and would not go
before he had delivered it. The government at
Yedo did not know what to do. The Japanese
are very shrewd, and understood quite well that
the samurai, armed with bow and arrow and in
old fashioned lacquered armor, were no match<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
for guns and cannon. The government was
<i>afraid to refuse</i> to receive the letter, and a year
later it signed a treaty, because <i>it was afraid</i> to
enter upon war with these strangers. The officers
of the government knew the strength of
the foreigners, but the samurai of the other
daimiyo did not; and when they heard that the
Shogun had entered into a treaty, <i>because he
was afraid</i>, they became angry and excited.
From that time it was certain that the Tokugawa
princes would be Shogun no longer. The
anger of the samurai increased when a new
treaty was made, in 1858, between the government
of Japan and that of the United States
through Mr. Townsend Harris. For the following
ten years there was trouble in Japan,
and the samurai began to think that Tenshi
Sama should drive the foreigners into the ocean.
That was easier said than done, but the samurai
did succeed in taking the government away
from the Tokugawa, and Tenshi Sama became
emperor indeed, and he is so still.</p>

<p>Mutsuhito,<a href="#A16">[16]</a> the Emperor of Japan, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
only a boy of fifteen when he was taken out
of his beautiful palace in 1867. He is now
(1900) forty-eight years old, and has seen
Japan grow from a poor little country into a
great and strong empire. Our story begins in
the year 1858, and will show how a Japanese
samurai boy was brought up.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II<br />
THE OLD YASHIKI</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Great</span> preparations for receiving guests
were being made in the Kano Yashiki
at Nagato. To-morrow would be the
fifth day of the eleventh month of the fourth
year of the oldest son and heir, and the boy
would be invested with the <i>hakama</i><a href="#A17">[17]</a> of the
samurai.</p>

<p>There would be a great gathering of the
Choshiu clan, for the Kano family had been
great in the council, and was trusted by daimiyo
and samurai alike. The history of the
Mori family was as much the history of that of
Kano, at least ever since Kano Shimpei had
tried to keep his lord from fighting Iyeyasu.
The Mori of that time had refused to heed his
knight&#8217;s advice, and sent him away in disgrace.
But Kano would not desert his master. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
had followed him to Osaka, and when the battle
was lost, had saved his lord by continuing to
fight until Mori was rescued by a small band
of devoted samurai. Kano himself died covered
with wounds. The Daimiyo of Choshiu
had never forgotten the advice nor the heroic
death of Kano Shimpei. They had honored
his descendants, and every Kano had tried to
show his great loyalty to his lord.</p>

<p>The Kano Yashiki stood within the outer
moat of Choshiu&#8217;s castle. A massive gateway
faced the street. On each side was a high, plastered
wall covered with tiles. This wall surrounded
the yashiki and its grounds, and gave
it the shape of a perfect square. The doors of
the gate were of heavy wood, plated with iron
and studded with huge iron bolts. They swung
inward on hinges, but were opened only for the
daimiyo, if he should honor his samurai with a
visit, or for a knight of equal rank of the owner.
For all other callers there was a little gate by
the side, where the guard could examine all that
entered or left.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>A short but broad road, composed of pulverized
shells mixed with soft white sand, led from
the gate to the samurai residence. It was a
fine two story building, with verandahs running
round the house. It was built upon posts about
two feet high and resting upon stones so that,
if an earthquake should happen, the building
could move with the wave of the earth. The
verandahs were made of kayaki<a href="#A18">[18]</a> wood, and
polished until it shone like a mirror. The building
was really a large and strong shed, with
thick posts upholding the roof with its heavy
tiles. There were no walls. Paper sho ji,<a href="#A19">[19]</a>
or sliding doors, set loosely in grooves, took
their place. They could be easily taken out,
to allow fresh air. These grooves were so arranged
that the whole floor could easily be
changed into several apartments or rooms. The
upper story had a balcony at the back, overlooking
the spacious and beautifully kept gardens,
with ponds, little hills, and copses of trees.
At the end of the balcony as well as on the
verandahs were closets, holding the ame,<a href="#A20">[20]</a> or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
rain doors. These were slid into deep grooves
along the outer edges of the verandahs and balcony
at night or when a storm arose.</p>

<p>The owner of the house was sitting in one of
the rooms at the back of the house. He was a
man of about thirty, of middle size, but strongly
built. His hibachi<a href="#A21">[21]</a> stood before him, but he
was evidently in deep thought. He did not expect
any visitors, for he had taken off his
hakama, and was sitting in his simple cotton
kimono,<a href="#A22">[22]</a> or gown.</p>

<p>Suddenly he clapped his hands three times.
The sound of: hai, hai!<a href="#A23">[23]</a> came from a distance,
and presently one of the sho ji was slid
aside, and Mrs. Kano appeared dutifully on
hands and knees. She could not be seen very
well, as she bowed her head upon her hands,
as a salute to her master and husband, but when
he remained silent, she raised her head and
asked softly:<a href="#A24">[24]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Did you call?&#8221;</p>

<p>She could be seen now. Mrs. Kano was perhaps
eighteen, certainly not more than nineteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
years old. Her jet black hair was done up in
a matronly coil and glistening with patchouli
or oil from the cactus plant. Her forehead was
fair, but eye-brows she had none, for a Japanese
wife, before her marriage, was compelled to
pull them out. Her teeth were of a shining
jet, another custom of married ladies. But,
disfigured as she was, her soft and gentle voice
showed that Mrs. Kano had been taught the
Onna Daigaku,<a href="#A25">[25]</a> or the Greater Learning for
Women, and that she was willing to try to
please her husband.</p>

<p>When he heard his wife&#8217;s voice, Kano looked
at her, bowed slightly, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have all preparations been made for to-morrow&#8217;s
reception?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she replied, &#8220;all your orders have
been obeyed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well,&#8221; he said, and she withdrew.</p>

<p>Kano was thinking of his son. He remembered
the death of his father, when he was
only eighteen years old. How he had looked
up to him! How gently, and yet how firmly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
had his father trained him in the manly exercises
of the samurai, hardening his body to
despise luxury and ready to bear cold or heat
at any time. How he had taught him the family
history, with its fine record of loyalty and
self sacrifice, and how he had commanded him
to follow in the same path. Kano felt that he
had done so. He remembered the illness which
had struck the strong man so suddenly and with
fatal ending, and which caused the son such a
deep pain. His father&#8217;s last words: &#8220;The wise
man of China says that the greatest disrespect
to a father is not to have any son,&#8221; had caused
him to marry as soon as the time of mourning
was over. And now he was a father himself,
and the time had come that he must begin to
train the child.</p>

<p>Had he done his duty, according to the laws
and custom of the samurai? Why, certainly.
On the seventy-fifth day after its birth, the child
had left off its baby-linen. On the hundred
and twentieth day it had been weaned. Every
ceremony had been observed as it should be by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
a gentleman of Kano&#8217;s family. Kano&#8217;s own
brother had fed the child, and My Lord&#8217;s cousin
had acted as sponsor. He had taken the child
on his left knee and as weaning father had
taken of the sacred rice which had been offered
to the gods. He had dipped his chop-sticks
three times in it, and then placed them in the
mouth of the child as if giving it some of the
rice juice. He had followed the honored custom
to feed the child three times from the five
cakes made of rice meal. When the three cups
of sake<a href="#A26">[26]</a> were brought on the tray, the sponsor
drank them and offered one to the child, now
restored to his guardian. The boy pretended
to drink two cups, and the sponsor had produced
his present. Every ceremony had been
observed, and the feast which followed had
shown that Kano intended to follow in the footsteps
of his fathers, in honoring the customs of
Old Japan.</p>

<p>Again on the fifteenth day of the eleventh
month, when the boy&#8217;s hair was allowed to
grow, not a single ceremony was neglected;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
and to-morrow Kano would prove once more
that he loved the customs of his father and was
willing to abide by them.</p>

<p>Again a sho ji slid open, but this time it attracted
Kano&#8217;s attention. A servant girl kneeling
on the door sill was waiting until her master
should speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>With a deep drawn breath, as if overwhelmed
at the honor of being spoken to, she replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Hattori<a href="#A27">[27]</a> wishes to speak to your
honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano rose hastily and, opening a cupboard,
seized his hakama and slipped it on over his
kimono. Thus prepared to receive his old-time
friend, he ordered the girl to admit him. A
moment later, and the visitor entered with a
shuffling gait, and, falling upon his knees, three
times touched his head to the ground. Kano
replied in the same manner, each in turn repeating
the same ceremonious phrases, which custom
demanded of men of their rank.</p>

<p>At last Hattori was seated upon the cushion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
which the servant had placed for him, and tea
was brought in. When the servant had withdrawn,
the two men smoked in silence, until
Hattori knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and
asked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano raised his brows slightly, and answered:</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand you. Do you mean
the sponsor? Certainly, I have seen him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! you are thinking of to-morrow! No,
I do not mean the sponsor or any one connected
with your family. Bah! I mean the new
guest we must entertain, and who will offer you
his congratulations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A new guest!&#8221; exclaimed Kano. &#8220;Surely,
I must be growing dull, for I fail to catch your
meaning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, then,&#8221; said Hattori, cautiously looking
into the garden, &#8220;another metsuké<a href="#A28">[28]</a> arrived
this afternoon from Yedo, and was bold
enough to come to the castle and demand to be
admitted. I was ordered to receive him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
find out what he wanted. When I came into
the room where he was waiting, he introduced
himself by handing me a letter from the Go rojiu,<a href="#A29">[29]</a>
to the clan. There were enough councillors
present to open it, so I excused myself
and called our friends. It was very brief and
to the point. The Go rojiu desires to mention
our clan as a model for Japan, and has therefore
sent this fellow to report.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is his name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sawa.&#8221;<a href="#A30">[30]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Sawa, Sawa,&#8221; repeated Kano slowly. &#8220;I
think I know the name. How old is he, do you
think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must be forty at least, and he seems cut
out for his work. His oily talk is disgusting;
and while he flatters you, his eyes are restlessly
peeping in every nook and corner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you done with him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The usual thing. We accepted the letter
and told him that we would deliberate carefully
about it, and let him have an answer in a couple
of days. He bowed himself out and was carried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
in his norimono<a href="#A31">[31]</a> to the hotel. But I hear
he has sent his servants to find out if he can not
rent a vacant yashiki. So, you see, he intends
to remain some time, and send in a full report.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano was silent. He was evidently displeased;
suddenly his attention as well as that
of his friend was drawn to a soft footstep on
the gravel walk of the garden, and presently a
young man appeared at the steps leading from
the verandah to the path. He faced the room
and bowed low. Both returned the salutation,
but Kano muttered between his teeth: &#8220;Ito!<a href="#A32">[32]</a>
What on earth brings him here?&#8221;</p>

THE MESSENGER</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> intruder, if he may be so called,
mounted the steps and, entering the
room, saluted in the usual manner.
He was invited to approach, and, clapping his
hands, Kano ordered the servant to bring in
another cushion, and fresh tea. When these
had been brought, and the visitor was seated,
Kano said:</p>

<p>&#8220;When did you leave Yedo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just a week ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there anything new?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, I think so. It is said openly by Tokugawa
men that the foreign devils, with whom
the Go rojiu have made a treaty, will be permitted
to settle down at Yokohama.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Settle down! What do you mean?&#8221; exclaimed
Hattori.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>&#8220;Where is Yokohama?&#8221; asked Kano.</p>

<p>Ito replied first to the question of his host.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yokohama is a little distance from the Tokaido,<a href="#A33">[33]</a>
near Kanagawa, the last post station
at this side of Yedo.&#8221; Then, turning toward
Hattori, he continued:&mdash;&#8220;Yes; the new treaty
permits them to buy land and to build houses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Hattori, aghast, &#8220;that means
that Japan is invaded. These foreign devils
have come with their fire ships and guns, and
by threats have accomplished their purpose.
What has become of the Tokugawa? Have
they lost their manhood, to submit to such a
disgrace!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Softly!&#8221; said Kano. &#8220;There may be reasons
why the Go rojiu has permitted them to
come so close to Yedo. It must be so. It must
be a trap to destroy the intruders in such a
manner that others like them will think twice
before they come again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could think so,&#8221; said Ito. &#8220;No!
I believe that the Tokugawa are afraid of an
invasion. Their samurai, with the exception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
of those of Mito and Aidzu,<a href="#A34">[34]</a> are not worth
their salt. Have you ever seen, during your
residence in Yedo, a Tokugawa Knight practising
at arms. They are quick enough to draw
their swords upon a beggar or a merchant, but
when they meet one of the samurai of the
southern clans, they fly to cover. No! Since Ii
Naosuke<a href="#A35">[35]</a> is regent, he has looked closely into
the forces which the Tokugawa can muster, if
a war should break out, and he thinks that it
must be avoided at any cost. Of course, he expects
that the samurai of the great clans will
be furious, and he has sent a large number of
spies to report what is said. One of these
gentry was sent here. I heard of it in time to
follow him, and I came on to warn you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Kano and Hattori expressed their
thanks, and Kano said:</p>

<p>&#8220;But if the Tokugawa are not able to prevent
a handful of foreigners from landing, how
can they expect that the great southern clans
will obey them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; replied Ito, smiling grimly; &#8220;we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
have been obedient for so many years, trembling
when the Go rojiu frowned, that the regent believes
it will continue forever. He had a meeting
of all the daimiyo connected with his clan,
and tried to convince them that we must now
receive these foreigners, and try to learn all
that they know. Then, when we can handle
their fire ships and their cannon, we may expect
to drive them into the sea.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_024f.jpg" alt="A JAPANESE FAMILY" /></div>
<p class="caption">A JAPANESE FAMILY.</p>

<p>Hattori put his hand upon his dagger, but
Kano, with a friendly motion of his hand,
calmed him. &#8220;There may be something in
that,&#8221; he said thoughtfully. &#8220;Mind you!&#8221; he
continued, &#8220;I do not underrate Japanese courage,
but we do not know the strength of these
barbarians. We have been living like frogs in
a well. It is easy enough to engage in war, but
it is best to know the number of the enemy,
before you engage in what may prove too heavy
odds. Such a thing would be foolish. But we
may come to a settlement with the Tokugawa.
If indeed, their samurai have lost their courage,
then my lord of Choshiu may recover the land<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
from which he was robbed, and I may avenge
my ancestor&#8217;s death. When will the councillors
of the clan meet?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The day after to-morrow,&#8221; replied Hattori.</p>

<p>Kano clapped his hands, and ordered the
servant to send up dinner for his guests and
himself. Hattori and Ito made some excuses,
but were easily induced to remain.</p>

<p>Small tables were brought in and placed before
each man. First sake or wine made from
rice, was served hot, and a small stone bottle
placed near each person; then there was <i>suimono</i>,
a sort of vegetable soup, after which
rice was ladled out into cups or bowls. A number
of side dishes, such as pickled <i>daikon</i>, a
sort of giant radish, <i>tsubo</i> or stewed sea-weed,
and soy, a sauce, were enjoyed by the samurai.</p>

<p>The conversation had been interrupted when
the servants entered, and was not resumed.
The men spoke of the ceremony to take place
the next day; and Ito was invited. Before
leaving, however, Kano told Hattori that he
would ask the councillors of the clan to remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
after the reception was over, so that they might
discuss their plans for the future.</p>

<p>Ito and Hattori bowed good-bye, as they
were going in different directions. Each carried
a lantern, for it was dark, and there was
no street lighting in Japan at that time. At
the corner of the street, Ito stopped as if in
doubt. Then, after a few moments, he seemed
to make up his mind, for he turned to the left,
and went hastily toward the castle entrance.
The heavy gate was closed, but the little side
gate stood ajar. Ito entered, and giving his
name to the officer of the guard, went along
the barracks where many of the samurai of
lower rank dwelt. At last he stopped before
a small door, and knocked softly. He heard
a shuffling of feet, and a woman&#8217;s voice demanded
who was there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Mr. Inouye<a href="#A36">[36]</a> in?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell him that Ito Saburo wishes to see
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman seemed satisfied, for the door<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
slid open, and Ito entered. Without waiting
he mounted the steps, and opening a sho ji,
stepped into a room, dimly lit by a rushlight
placed in a paper lantern. Ito fell on his knees,
and saluted in the usual manner, which salute
was returned by the owner of the room, a man
of Ito&#8217;s age, but of more slender build.</p>

<p>The two men had not met for two years; for
Ito had been ordered to remain at the Choshiu
yashiki in Yedo, and Inouye&#8217;s duties had kept
him at Nagato. But they had corresponded by
every courier carrying letters to and from the
capital, for they had been friends ever since
they were little boys. Yet when they met after
such a long absence, there was no glad
&#8220;Helloh!&#8221; with a hearty clasp of the hand, as
we would meet an old friend. Pleased as they
were to see each other again, they had been
taught that good breeding demands that gentlemen
should always show courtesy and respect
to others of their own rank. Certain
sentences must be uttered before any ordinary
conversation can begin. Therefore Ito said:</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>&#8220;I was very rude the last time we met, but
I hope you have forgiven me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Inouye, &#8220;it was I who was
rude, and I pray you to overlook it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is needless to say that neither of them had
really been rude, but custom demanded that
this should be said, and the same custom prevails
in Japan to-day. We think that it is foolish,
and the Japanese think us very rude, because
we do not obey that custom.</p>

<p>After these customs had been observed, the
two friends sat down, and Ito said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Has any progress been made in your
studies of the barbarian nations?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing worth boasting. I have been
twice to Nagasaki to try if I could pick up
some of the books of the Hollanders, but the
Tokugawa officers will not permit any stranger
to approach the island of Deshima, unless they
are bribed with more money than I possess.
Still, I have learned enough to know that
Japan is not in a condition to fight the barbarians,
and I am afraid, I think, that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
regent was right in submitting to their demands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think so,&#8221; replied Ito. &#8220;Right!
What right has the Tokuwaga to sell an inch
of Japan&#8217;s soil. It does not belong to them.
It is the property of Tenshi Sama, if it belongs
to anybody. It makes me angry to think that
we can no longer boast that</p>


<p class="center">The foot of the invader has never trod our soil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There will be no invasion,&#8221; said Inouye.
&#8220;These men only want to trade. If they had
intended to use force, they would have done
so when they came the second time, with a
large fleet. No! I do not believe that our
country is in danger, at least not for some
years. But they may come as spies to find out
what opportunity there is to obtain possession
of Japan. The Yedo government should try
to discover what the intentions of the barbarians
really are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Yedo government is only anxious to
make money. You do not know, Inouye, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
good it feels to breathe the pure air of Nagato.
It is stifling at Yedo. Spies, spies are everywhere.
The Tokugawa samurai seem to have
forgotten that they are gentlemen, and how a
samurai should behave. They are quick
enough to draw their swords upon men who
cannot defend themselves, but they are nimble
with their feet when hard blows may be expected.
If Japan must go to war, we, the
samurai of the south will do the fighting. The
day of the Tokuwaga is past.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a brief silence, when Inouye said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not yet asked you what brings you
here. I had not heard that you had been relieved
from duty at Yedo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not relieved. But we were informed
that the Go rojiu intended to send new spies to
the southern diamiyo, and I was ordered to
inform the councillors of the clan. It seems
that Sawa, the chief spy, arrived just before
me. I suppose I shall be told to return to Yedo,
but I hope not. At any rate I shall see you
before I leave.&#8221;</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>After the usual salutations Ito rose and lit
his candle. After leaving the door, he went
through the grounds to the opposite barracks,
where his mother lived. Knocking at the little
wicket, he was admitted with many bows and
glad exclamations. These he returned with
some pleasant words, and entered the sitting-room.
Presently his mother entered, and both
knelt down and saluted in the respectful and
courteous manner of their people. There was
no kissing or even handshaking; both were, of
course, very happy, but Japanese law forbade
showing joy, even in the expression of the face.
Ito would have obeyed at once any order his
mother might have given him; but she considered
him as the head of the family, and showed
that she looked upon him as the master of the
house.</p>

THE FIFTH DAY OF THE ELEVENTH MONTH</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> day broke calm and smiling. Japan,
especially those parts around the Inland
Sea, has a lovely climate. It is
seldom that the sky is not of a deep blue color,
and the days are few when children cannot play
or walk in the streets. They are rarely kept in
the house. Young babies are securely fastened
upon the backs of children six or seven years
old, and sent into the streets. There are no
noisy games. Girls play sometimes battledore
and shuttlecock, but the boys are too dignified.
American boys would be surprised if they saw
two Japanese school friends meet in the street.
They do not approach with a hop, skip and
jump, or clap each other on the shoulder. Oh
no! They stop as soon as they meet, take off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
their caps, for all Japanese schoolboys wear
now a sort of soldier cap, and then bow almost
to the ground. Then they draw a deep breath,
and each continues on his way.</p>

<p>The great difference between Japanese and
American boys of the same age, is that all our
boys are fond of fun, and we are glad to see
them have a good time, while a Japanese boy
would not be able to understand what we call
fun. Our boys would soon grow sick if there
were not some time in the day when they could
make all the noise they wished. If a Japanese
boy should make even the slightest unnecessary
noise at home, his parents would think that the
world had turned topsy-turvy. From his
earliest youth, the boy is trained not to show
his feelings. In all the years of my life in
Japan, I have never seen a boy of over six years
old with tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>It is eleven o&#8217;clock, and the guests begin to
arrive. They come mostly on foot, for they
all live in the neighborhood; but there are a
few who hold such a high rank that they can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
only leave their yashiki in a sedan chair, or on
horseback. A servant brings a large bundle,
carefully wrapped. It is taken to the back
room which has been made much larger by the
removal of several sho ji. Here Mr. Kano sits
in hakama and <i>haori</i>,<a href="#A37">[37]</a> receiving each guest as
he enters according to his rank in the clan. To
some his bows are deeper and more prolonged,
with others they are more simple, although at
the entrance of every guest, his forehead
touches his hands, spread out upon the floor
before him. The visitors take their places
about the room in the order of their rank, each
saluting the host as he enters and thereafter
the guests. Waitresses in a kneeling posture
serve tea. At last a man of dignified bearing,
clothed in rich silk, enters, and after saluting,
sits down upon a cushion prepared for him
near the master of the house. Kano is about
to clap his hands, as a signal for his son to be
brought in, when a man-servant opens a sho ji,
and kneeling with his head almost touching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
the mats, crawls toward his master. He
whispers:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Sawa of Yedo desires to present his
respects.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano slightly raises his eyebrows, but by
a slight bending forward indicates that the
new-comer shall be admitted. After a few
moments the latest guest enters and prostrates
himself before his host, who returns the compliment.
Kano with a slight motion of the
arm indicates the place which he intends him to
occupy, and Sawa, crouching and bowing to the
guests proceeds in that direction. It is between
the seats of the councillors and those of the
chief samurai, and, as it happens, next to that
of Ito.</p>

<p>Not a single glance showed that the visitor
was unwelcome. No expression of approval
had escaped their lips upon the entrance of a
popular member of the clan, and not a sign
showed that Sawa&#8217;s appearance at this time
was resented. They sat unmoved, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
North American Indian chiefs. Kano clapped
his hands, and the servant brought in a board,
resembling one of our checkerboards; it was
placed upon the mat near the father, facing the
point of the compass which had been declared
lucky by a fortune teller. The gentleman at
Kano&#8217;s side then clapped his hands, and another
servant brought in the package which
had been delivered before. It was unwrapped,
and contained a Kimono of fine silk, with beautifully
embroidered storks and tortoises, fir
trees and bamboos. This was as it should be.
Storks and tortoises promised long life to the
boy; for the Japanese believed that the stork
lives a thousand years, and the tortoise ten
thousand. The fir tree never changes its color,
therefore the child will possess an unchanging
virtuous heart, and the bamboo, as it shoots up
straight, will give him an upright mind.</p>

<p>The servant holds up the dress for the inspection
of the guests, who, after looking at
it, express their approval by bowing low, and
a deep drawn sigh. Presently Mrs. Kano, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
has been watching the ceremony from a near
apartment through a convenient slit in the sho
ji, enters leading the boy. Both kneel at the
entrance and after touching the ground three
times with the forehead, the child is brought
to his father, who places him upon the checkerboard
facing the east, because that is the lucky
point. The mother dresses him in the Kimono
presented by the sponsor, and puts on the hakama;
then the child receives an imitation
sword and dirk, which are placed in his sash.
Then sake is brought in and the sponsor and
child exchange cups. This ends the ceremony
which admits the three-year-old boy among
the samurai of the clan.</p>

<p>Mother and son, after repeating their salutations,
leave the room and refreshments are
served. Gradually the sense of ceremony disappears,
and conversation becomes more general.
Kano, apparently deeply engaged in
talking with the sponsor, keeps a watchful eye
over his guests, and frequently casts a glance
toward the spot occupied by Sawa. The sponsor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
an elderly gentleman of dignified bearing,
at last notices his host&#8217;s looks, and says:</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is that gentleman? He is a stranger
to me, and I cannot distinguish his coat of
arms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He bears the Tokugawa crest, your lordship,&#8221;
replies Kano, &#8220;and is the new O Metsuke,
whom the Council at Yedo have kindly
sent to report upon our model clan.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old gentleman did not notice the sarcasm.
&#8220;When did he arrive, and why was his
arrival not made known to me?&#8221; he inquired
in a slightly offended tone. Kano bowed, and
replied:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Sawa arrived yesterday afternoon,
and presented his letter at the castle, where
Councillor Hattori was ordered to receive him.
As we had not been notified by the Go rojiu of
their intention to send us a metsuké, Mr. Hattori
thought that the letter should be submitted
to the council of the clan. I have noticed that
he has spoken to the councillors, who will wait
here until the other guests have withdrawn.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
If it please your lordship, we shall be glad to
have the benefit of your advice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I cannot spare the time, and the matter
is of no great importance,&#8221; declared his
lordship, continuing his repast. Presently they
were joined by Hattori, for whom a cushion
was brought, and who, after the prescribed
bows of respect, took no further notice of
Mori&#8217;s cousin.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, friend Kano,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you
may as well keep an eye upon your honored
guest, Mr. Sawa. The fellow seems to think
that he is at Yedo, instead of in a gentleman&#8217;s
yashiki and that he can do as he pleases. He
has filled his sake cup quite often, and has been
offensive, to judge by the looks of Ito.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have perceived it,&#8221; replied Kano, &#8220;but
Ito will, I am sure, keep his temper, and settle
with the intruder upon a more favorable occasion.
I am more afraid of the young fellows
who seem to have heard some insulting remarks.
Pray, entertain his lordship, while I
dismiss the guests.&#8221; Without waiting for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
reply, Kano rose and, bowing before each
guest, advanced toward Sawa. There he knelt
down and performed the usual salutations
somewhat stiffly. Sawa returned them as well
as he could.</p>

<p>When they had regained their upright positions,
Kano addressed his self-invited guest,
and said in a tone loud enough for some young
samurai close by to hear:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am deeply grateful to the Go rojiu for
remembering me on this occasion. I do not
know how I deserved this honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sawa had some difficulty to hide a grin.
Did this country bumpkin really fancy that the
great Council of the Tokugawa cared anything
about him or his family. Amused at the
thought, he bowed, and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;The Go rojiu no doubt, if it had only
known of the event, would have been glad to
honor his host upon this occasion. It was
known,&#8221; he added more soberly and looking
sharply at Kano, &#8220;that the Choshiu clan was
directed almost entirely by the wisdom of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
entertainer, and the question had been discussed
to secure his services for the Council. Unfortunately
the law of Iyeyasu forbade it. Only
members of the Tokugawa clan were permitted
to serve the Shogun. But this did not prevent
the Council from profiting by the wisdom of
Kano the Councillor, and it was to secure this
benefit that he, Sawa, had been directed to reside
in the clan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano bowed, and replied. &#8220;It is a very
great honor, indeed, and, no doubt, well deserved
by such an able man as my guest. Pray,
make yourself at home in the clan. You will
find every Choshiu gentleman glad to receive a
samurai from the capital, where he has advantages
to learn manners which we in the country
do not possess. But every samurai is glad to
excel in chivalry, and we of Choshiu no less
than those of other clans.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again they bowed, and Sawa resumed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand that this joyful event will be
followed by a meeting of the Honorable Council?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>&#8220;The regular meeting is to-morrow,&#8221; replied
Kano. &#8220;I have received no notice of any
extra meeting, nor have I sent out any. It
seems to me that you are misinformed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me, my host. Who is that young
man, who happened to be my neighbor during
the most interesting ceremony? I fancy that
I have seen him at Yedo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is probably so. Indeed, it may have
been very recently, for he arrived yesterday.
Choshiu&#8217;s yashiki seems to have suffered
severely from the last earthquake, and expensive
repairs are necessary. Our officer in charge
thought it necessary to send a special messenger,
but why he did not commission an older
man, is beyond my comprehension.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sawa began to perceive that this country
bumpkin was quite able to parry his thrusts;
he did not want to give offense, and besides
began to feel sleepy. He therefore informed
his host of his intention to return to his inn.
Kano raised no objection, and after the usual
leave taking, escorted his guest to the door, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
saw him leave the gate. Calling a young
samurai, he bade him see that Sawa did not
return to the yashiki, whereupon he re-entered
the room. The other guests, seeing that the
councillors lingered, withdrew all except Ito,
who was asked to wait as he might be wanted.</p>

THE COUNCIL OF THE CLAN</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Before</span> he seated himself, Kano called
his chief samurai, and told him to have
the sho ji put in so as to make the
apartment of the usual size. He also ordered
him to have several men patrol the garden, and
to see that no one could approach the house,
while he himself was to move noiselessly
through the adjoining rooms, and answer for
it that there should be no listener. Knowing
that his orders would be obeyed, he sat down,
ordered tea and hibachi to be brought, and
without further ceremony opened the meeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Honorable Councillors,&#8221; he said, &#8220;two
messengers have come from Yedo. You have,
no doubt, noticed them, for both were here during
the ceremony in my humble house. The
first one is the new metsuke, Sawa, whom it has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
pleased the Go rojiu to appoint to our clan.
When Mr. Hattori informed me of his arrival,
I could not understand the cause of his appointment.
Our clan has had no trouble with
the Tokugawa for many years; and, although
there can be no friendship between the house of
Iyeyasu and that of Mori, there has been no
open hostility.</p>

<p>&#8220;The arrival of the second messenger explains
the situation. The Go rojiu has entered
into a new treaty with the barbarians, and permitted
them to dwell at Yokohama, near Kanagawa
on the Tokaido. This fine piece of news
is discussed openly at Yedo, and there is no
doubt of its truth. The Regent, naturally I
think, feels somewhat anxious as to how the
great clans will receive it, and has probably sent
metsuke to other model clans besides Choshiu.
The news is so important that our friend Hattori
agreed with me to ask you to discuss it
here privately, so that we may decide upon the
policy of our clan. Honorable Mr. OKubo,
what is your opinion?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>The person thus addressed was the oldest of
the councillors, a man grown gray in the service
of his clan. He was silent for some moments,
gravely sipping his tea. Then he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;These questions are not for me to answer.
I am only acquainted with Old Japan, as it has
existed for hundreds of years, and I am afraid
the arrival of these barbarians is a menace to
our country. I don&#8217;t know them, and do not
wish to know them; but I do know that, before
the Tokugawa were thought of, the barbarians
came, and were received kindly by the children
of the gods. What was their gratitude? They
began to teach a cult which destroyed the relations
between parent and child, master and
servant, lord and retainer. They were finally
expelled, but it cost years of strife, and myriads
of lives before their teaching was rooted
out of the country. Since then order has been
restored, and we have had peace. Now the
barbarians will be admitted again, and fresh
troubles will commence. Younger and
stronger heads than mine will be needed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
save our clan and the house of Mori, although,
if it comes to war, I shall claim the honor of
dying fighting for our lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>All bowed but protested that OKubo was
strong and able enough to lead the councils of
the clan; but he replied that his time of usefulness
was past, and Kano, out of respect for his
wish, addressed the councillor next in years.
That gentleman did not see any danger to the
clan. Yokohama was a long distance from
Nagato, and if there was to be trouble with the
barbarians, the Tokugawa would be the first
sufferers, for it was within the territory belonging
to the Shogun. As to the metsuke, why,
they must do as they had done before with
such fellows, surround him with spies of their
own.</p>

<p>Thus every councillor spoke in turn, the
opinion of each being received with grave courtesy.
A little more interest was shown when
Hattori began to speak. It was known that he
was in Kano&#8217;s confidence, and it was a standing
joke that Kano&#8217;s advice was always adopted.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>&#8220;Honorable Councillors,&#8221; said Hattori,
bowing deeply, &#8220;it ill becomes a man of my
age to dispute the opinions of the leaders who
for many years have guided the policy of our
clan with brilliant success. If I venture to
differ with them, it may be from lack of wisdom
and experience, but I shall be glad if I
am corrected. It is only by the kind teaching
of such men as the honorable councillors, that
men of my age can be prepared to follow in
their footsteps.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid that the coming of the barbarians
promises evil days, not only for the Tokugawa,
but for all the clans. You, gentlemen,
remember, how the arrival of the fireships and
the signing of the first treaty was followed by
incessant earthquakes,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2"  class="fnanchor">[B]</a> how the ocean rose in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
its fury, and overwhelmed the barbarian ship,
supposed to be safely at anchor at Shimoda.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>
Surely, gentlemen, the gods of Japan themselves
fought for our country. But the
Go rojiu was blind. Was not the Shogun
Iyeyoshi himself killed for not defying the
barbarians by expelling them? &#8216;We are not
strong enough,&#8217; says the Regent. There was a
time when the countless hosts of Kublai Khan,
the conqueror of the world, were hurled upon
our shores. What became of them? Tenshi
Sama prayed to his ancestors and they, the gods
of our country, destroyed the invader. We have
nothing to fear, except our own faint-heartedness.
Are we, the samurai of Japan, unworthy
of our ancestors? Have our muscles grown
weak that we can no longer wield the sword?
Out upon us, then, for cowards! If the Tokugawa
be a coward, out upon the Tokugawa.
Choshiu, Kaga, Satsuma, and Tosa, ought to
be able to dispose of the foreigners and at the
same time of the Tokugawa brood. Let us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
send confidential messengers to those clans,
and, after we have arranged with them, send
Mr. Sawa back to Yedo, securely packed in a
box labelled: This side up; handle with
care!&#8221;</p>



<p>A smile of approbation passed through the
assembly; only Kano&#8217;s face showed no sign. It
was now his turn to speak, and, after toying
with his fan, as if collecting his thoughts, he
began:</p>

<p>&#8220;Honorable Councillors, I agree with the
last speaker that the arrival of the foreigners
bodes evil for our country. I do not believe
that they will try to make war upon us, unless
indeed, we provoke it ourselves. At the present
time, at any rate, we are not in a condition
to provoke a quarrel. For the past two hundred
years the world has moved, and we have
stood still; that is why we are helpless. We
have found out something. These barbarians
possess ships which go wherever they want
them, without regard to tide and wind. We
must have such ships and learn how to handle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
them. We, sons of Japan, are not naturally
brainless; we can learn what the barbarians
have learned, and by hard work, we may be
able to surpass them. There may be some
trouble with the Tokugawa, but I do not think
so, unless they send us another metsuke besides
Mr. Sawa. I have taken the measure of that
gentleman, and do not think that it would take
much gold to make him deaf and blind. But
we need not take him into our confidence. We
should send a trusty messenger to Nagasaki,
and at whatever cost buy some of the books of
the Hollanders. Surely, some merchants will
be found there who understand that language
and teach us. Besides, we must repair our
forts, and buy new cannon. Our samurai must
practice with their arms during every moment
of leisure. Then, gentlemen, when the time
comes, we shall be prepared, be it to avenge
Sekigahara and the Castle of Osaka, or to
drive the barbarian into the sea. My honored
ancestor gave the same advice to our illustrious
lord&#8217;s forefather. Oh! that it had been accepted.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Mori looks now upon Kii and Owari,<a href="#A38">[38]</a>
and grinds his teeth at the thought that their
people, once his property, are now arraigned
among his foes. Kano&#8217;s arm and muscle are
as ready for the fray, as those of the youngest
warrior, and he will not be the last to unsheath
his sword, nor the first to return it to its scabbard.
Self-restraint is often much more difficult
than exposure to danger.</p>

<p>&#8220;The advice of Mr. Hattori supposes that the
councillors of Kaga, Satsuma, and Tosa are of
our opinion. But we have a feud with Satsuma,
who might seize such an opportunity to
bring all the power of the Tokugawa down
upon us. It is said, and I believe it from what
I have seen at Yedo, that the samurai of the
Shogun have lost their courage. But what of
Mito, Aidzu, Kii, Owari, and the host of other
daimiyo ready to march at the Go rojiu&#8217;s bidding.
Gentlemen, an excuse for the Tokugawa
to fall upon us <i>at this time</i>, would mean ruin
for our clan. We cannot even entertain the
thought. But we must watch for our opportunity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
and when it comes we must be prepared
to strike. At present, let it be understood that
Mr. Sawa must be perfectly safe in whatever
part of Choshiu&#8217;s domain, but let him be followed,
and let his every step be dogged. Every
word he utters, even in his sleep, and every
syllable he writes must be known to us. Mr.
Hattori, will you please, see to it that this is
done.&#8221;</p>

<p>The council agreed with Kano, as it had
always done; and it was decided that a sum
of money should be placed at Kano&#8217;s disposal
to procure the necessary books and a teacher
at Nagasaki. These resolutions were drawn
up, and sent to the adviser of the daimiyo to
be sealed, after which they became a law.</p>

<p>And the daimiyo? Oh! he was a <i>Great Name</i>
only. He never interfered with the affairs of
the clan, and did not know anything about
them. It was the same with the Shogun at
Yedo. His seal was used, and laws were made
of which he had never heard; and so it was
with Tenshi Sama at Kyoto. All these men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
Daimiyo, Shogun, and Tenshi Sama were considered
as gods, and nobody but their highest
servants were ever allowed to look upon them.
If any of them was compelled to travel, they
were placed in a norimono, with close blinds,
and men ran ahead crying: Shita ni iru!<a href="#A39">[39]</a>
Down on your knees. Very few people knew
the names of the councillors who did rule in
Japan, but the names of those who did not
rule, were generally known.</p>

YOUNG KANO GROWS UP</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">While</span> the Choshiu clan as well as the
other clans of Japan, were anxiously
watching the opening of
Japan and the events which follow, Young
Kano or Kano Ekichi<a href="#A40">[40]</a> was taken gradually
out of his mother&#8217;s hands and given to a faithful
attendant of his father to be educated as a
true samurai should be. Japanese boys are not
baptized for there are few Japanese Christians,
and in those days there were none; they have,
therefore, no baptismal name. They have,
however, given names, which are placed behind
the family name instead of before it as
we do. They would say, for instance, instead
of Henry Jones, Jones Henry; they do the same
with the words Mister, Master, Mistress or
Miss, for all of which they have only one expression:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
San. If we should speak to master
Ekichi Kano, we should say Kano Ekichi San.
These given names can be changed without any
difficulty. Sometimes the parents change them,
at other times the owner of the name changes
it himself, and again the Emperor or Tenshi
Sama gives an officer a new name. But in that
case, it is sure that the owner will keep it so
long as he lives.</p>

<p>I can&#8217;t say that Ekichi had a very pleasant
time of it, although, of course, his father and
mother loved him. Only they did not show it,
as our parents do. As a little baby he was
made to rest upon his knees, so that they might
grow flexible, for the Japanese do not sit upon
chairs, but squat upon their mats. When he
rose in the morning from his futon<a href="#A41">[41]</a> or comforter
which served him as a bed, there was
no running to his father or mother, shouting
good morning, and giving them a hug or a
hearty kiss. When he did meet them, the first
thing was to fall on his knees, spread his hands
flat before him, and bow until his head rested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
upon the back of his hands. His father and
mother gravely returned the salutation in the
same manner. When he took his meals, he was
not permitted to say a word. He ate what was
put before him, and it was every day the same.
Asa meshi, hiru meshi, and ban meshi, or in
English, morning rice, noon rice, and evening
rice, there was no difference between breakfast,
dinner, and supper. Until he was six years
old, Ekichi spent most of his time with his
attendant in the garden. They strolled around,
and he asked questions which the man answered
as well as he could. He was taught
how to speak to a superior, to an equal, and to
an inferior; how long he must remain prostrate
before a daimiyo, before a councillor,
and before a simple samurai. He was also
taken to the grave of his grandfather, and told
to kneel down and say his prayers. That was
something he could not understand, and which
his attendant could not explain; when he asked
him, and he did often, the man would say:
&#8220;It is so, but you should not ask why, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
the gods only know.&#8221; So, when Ekichi was
tired and sat down on the sward, he would
often think: What is the use of praying at
the grave of a dead man. But he was careful
not to express his thoughts to anybody.</p>

<p>He was trained not to show pain, distress, or
grief. Whatever happened to him, his face
must not betray it. Being constantly in the
open air, he grew up healthy and strong, and
when he was six years old, he was taken to a
school for samurai boys.</p>

<p>Ekichi had been with his attendant beyond
the gates of his yashiki, but after the first day,
he was told to go and return by himself. He
met his schoolfellows with the courtesy which
he had been taught so carefully, and was treated
by them in the same way. There was no playground.
Indeed, I do not believe that any of
those boys knew what the word &#8220;play&#8221; means.
Many times, thirty years ago, I have seen
samurai boys from eight to sixteen years old,
during recess or after schooltime retire to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
rooms to smoke their tiny pipes and carry on
a quiet conversation; but I never saw them
play. The government of Japan has found out
that baseball, football, and cricket, are healthy
games, and is encouraging these boys to indulge
in them. But at that time, a samurai lad
would have felt hurt at the thought that he
could do such a thing as play.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_058f.jpg" alt="IT IS REALLY A DAY DEVOTED TO HACHIMAN" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;IT IS REALLY A DAY DEVOTED TO HACHIMAN, THE GOD OF WAR.&#8221;</p>

<p>All Japanese boys are very quiet; they are
brought up that way; but for the children of
the people certain holidays are set apart. The
fifth of May, or the fifth day of the fifth month
is the boys&#8217; festival. It is really a day devoted
to Hachiman, the god of war, but it is also
called the Feast of Flags. A tall bamboo is
erected near every house where a boy was born;
for every son a fish, properly shaped and a
very good imitation made of air-tight sacks
is fastened, with its mouth wide open by
means of bamboo hoops. The air enters and,
besides inflating the body, causes it to squirm,
flap, and dart, about the bamboo. They have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
other days, but the samurai boys do not observe
them. There is still a wide distance between
them and the children of the people.</p>

<p>At the time when Ekichi Kano went to
school, the children squatted upon the mats,
and learned the Japanese syllabary,&mdash;for there
is no alphabet in Japan,&mdash;each vowel is connected
with a consonant, and thus forms a
syllable. The vowels are the same as with us:</p>

<p class="center">
a, i, u, e, o,<br />
pron. ah, ee, oo, ay, oh,<br />
and combined with the consonants<br />
ka, ki, ku, ke, ko,<br />
na, ni, nu, ne, no, etc.</p>

<p>Ekichi, like almost all Japanese boys of his
class, learned very quickly, nor did the very
difficult Chinese characters frighten him. Long
before a Chinese boy could have mastered one-half
of them, Ekichi could read and understand
a book without much difficulty.</p>

<p>He was now growing used to the restraint
which was imposed upon him. He began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
understand that the word <i>pleasure</i> can have
no meaning for a Japanese boy, and then he
was made to learn that a boy is better without
comforts than with them, except when he
is sick. He was taught that there can be and
must be but one motive for every action, and
that motive must be: duty. Ekichi was but a
child, and small for his age; but no boy twice
as old in America or Europe, could have shown
an equal degree of self-control, and contempt
of pain and death with this child.</p>

<p>Japan&#8217;s laws were cruel, at this time, and
most offenses were punished with death. The
criminal was made to kneel down, a flash of
the sharp sword, a blow, and the head lay severed
from the body. Young as he was, Ekichi
was often taken to these executions, to accustom
him to the sight of blood. His face was
closely watched to see if he showed any emotion,
and when he came home from these disagreeable
sights, he found his rice of the color
of blood, for it had been colored on purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
with the juice of salted plums. He was expected
to eat heartily of this dish, and, like
other samurai boys, did so without the nauseous
feelings which our boys would experience
under the circumstances. Sometimes, at midnight,
he was roused from a sound slumber,
and ordered to go to the execution ground, and
bring a head. There was no refusal possible.
Whatever he might think privately of such an
errand, there was but one answer possible, a
responsive hai! &#8220;yes,&#8221; and immediate obedience.
Thus Ekichi, as all other Japanese boys
of his class, was indifferent to heat or cold, and
forgot that there was such a thing as &#8220;fear.&#8221;
He was not quite twelve, when he was given
two real swords, sharp, keen blades, made for
use and not for show. He was taught that
&#8220;the sword is the soul of the samurai,&#8221; or, in
the words of the law as it then prevailed in
Japan<a href="#A42">[42]</a>: &#8220;The girded sword is the living
soul of the samurai. In the case of a samurai
forgetting his sword, act as is appointed: it
may not be forgiven.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>The child never considered his swords as
toys; to him they were objects of reverence;
that little dirk, eight inches long, might at some
time be used to end his own life. He learned
how he should behave and act, if ever such a
moment should come. There is an instance in
Japanese history, when a samurai boy only
seven years old, committed suicide that he
might save his father. Such stories were told
him constantly, and roused his enthusiasm.
At no time, after he was twelve years old,
would Ekichi have hesitated to take his own
life, if he had thought it his duty.</p>

<p>At this age he divided his time between
shooting with bow and arrow, riding, fencing
and wrestling, and the study of Chinese. He
learned to swim and to handle a boat, and as
he grew stronger, all dainties and comforts
were taken away. If, in winter, his hands became
numb, he was told to rub them in snow
or water to make them warm; but he was not
allowed the use of a fire. The duty of implicit
obedience had been planted in him. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Japanese boy would think of asking why?
when ordered to do something. Last of all he
became master of that exceeding courtesy, peculiar
to Japanese gentlemen, and which we
foreigners cannot appreciate.</p>

KANO&#8217;S JOURNEY TO YEDO</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> 1st of July, 1859, had come and
gone, and the barbarians had been admitted
into the Country of the Gods.
They were only a handful; so few that Choshiu&#8217;s
samurai could have pushed them into the
bay by sheer force of numbers. While the
Japanese people continued to toil, and cared
nothing if there were any barbarians in the
country or not, the samurai were getting more
and more angry. Still, there was much curiosity
mixed with this anger. The barbarians
were so few in number; how could the Tokugawa,
able to call an army of 80,000 men
under arms, be afraid of them.</p>

<p>That puzzled Choshiu&#8217;s councillors. They
had not succeeded in their attempts to obtain
books and a teacher at Nagasaki, and it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
been decided that another effort should be
made at Yokohama. This time the enterprise
was thought so important, that it was determined
to send one of the councillors, and the
choice fell upon Kano. He accepted the commission.</p>

<p>When the councillors separated, Kano requested
his friend Hattori to call that evening,
as he wished to consult him. Hattori agreed
to do so, and punctually to the time appeared
at the Kano yashiki.</p>

<p>When the two friends were seated, Kano
said, &#8220;I have been thinking how I shall go.
At first I thought of asking a Go rojiu passport
through our <i>honest</i> friend Sawa, who will do
anything we ask of him, as soon as he sees our
gold. But I am afraid it will not do. The
Go rojiu must, by this time, have grown suspicious
at the excellent reports furnished by
their metsuke, and I should certainly be
shadowed as soon as they heard that one
of Choshiu&#8217;s councillors was visiting the
Kwantô.<a href="#A43">[43]</a> With spies constantly at my heels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
I could not do anything; therefore, nobody except
you, must know of my absence. I must,
of course, trust my household, but I know that
I can do that, I have decided to fall suddenly
ill and call for a physician who will tell me
that it is a slow fever. So I shall not want him
again, since he cannot cure me anyhow. You
must call two or three times a week, and spread
the report that I am neither better nor worse.
If our fellow-councillors ask for me, tell them
that I intend to start at an early day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how will you pass the barriers on the
Tokaido and the Nakasendo<a href="#A44">[44]</a>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall probably go by sea from Hyogo. I
know that this journey is one of danger, but I
must not risk the clan. I have, therefore, written
to My Lord that I am no longer one of his
samurai, but a <i>rônin</i>.<a href="#A45">[45]</a> You must keep this
paper and deliver it to the Council only in case
I am arrested.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hattori bowed in assent, took the paper and
hid it within the folds of his kimono. He then
asked: &#8220;Are you going alone?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>&#8220;No. I must take a trusty young fellow
with me, if something should happen to me.
First I thought of Ito, but he is in Tokyo, and
may be watched. I have sent for his friend
Inouye, who, I am sure, has his wits about
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly think that a man like Inouye, who
is more given to studying than to tramping
about, will like such an adventure,&#8221; said Hattori,
smiling. &#8220;But if he consents, you could
have no better man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what I thought. He has, moreover,
this advantage, that he can not be known
to any Tokugawa officer, since he has never
been at Yedo.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When will you leave?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sooner the better, to-night, if I can induce
my intended companion to leave his books
so soon. Ah! here he is!&#8221;</p>

<p>A servant had announced the visitor by opening
a sho ji, and permitting him to enter. The
customary salutations passed, and Inouye was
requested to join the two friends. Kano scanned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
him closely, and, evidently pleased with the result,
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Inouye, you can serve the clan; are you
willing to do so, even though it involves considerable
danger?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With all my heart,&#8221; replied Inouye simply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you, in name of the clan. How
long will it take you to get ready for a long
journey?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can go now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Kano and Hattori smiled with pleasure
at the young man&#8217;s brief replies, and the former
explained his scheme in all its bearings. When
he had finished Inouye said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I thank you, Mr. Councillor, very much for
having thought me worthy of this honor, and I
shall try not to disappoint you. If you permit
me, I shall now write a similar letter to My
Lord Mori, and perhaps Mr. Hattori will do me
the favor to keep it with that of your honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hattori bowed, and Kano, begging to be excused,
withdrew while Inouye was writing his
letter. Kano went directly to the room where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
his wife was. He entered, and, without forgetting
to pay her due respects, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am leaving on a long journey, but I want
people to think that I am ill. I shall, therefore,
lie down, and do you send for a physician. Before
he comes, send for Mr. Fujii,<a href="#A46">[46]</a> I shall tell
him what to do in my absence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano&#8217;s instructions were followed. The
physician went home very proud at having discovered
at once the councillor&#8217;s sickness. He
was sorry that he had been dismissed, but felt
that Kano was right. All his medicines could
not cure such a fever. And when he thought
of the fee in his pocket, his heart almost leaped
for joy. It was more than he had received in
six months.</p>

<p>The following morning, long before sunrise
and while everybody in the Yashiki was fast
asleep, Mr. Fujii cautiously opened the little
gate, and two samurai, with their faces half
hidden in a cloth wrapped around their heads,
stepped briskly out. They wore straw sandals,
so that their footsteps were inaudible. Fujii<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
bowed deeply, and received a parting bow in return,
but not a word was spoken. After passing
across the moat, they came to the great
highway and turned eastward. When the sun
rose they had covered ten miles, and decided to
stop for breakfast at the first yadoya<a href="#A47">[47]</a> they
should see.</p>

<p>After six days&#8217; traveling without meeting
any adventure, although they had met several
ruffian-looking rônin, they approached Hyogo.
They had carefully discussed their plans and
decided to take passage in some trading junk,
bound for Yedo or Kanagawa. If they could
not do so, they would hire a boat. Kano had
been many times along this road, in charge of
Mori&#8217;s procession, and knew Hyogo well. But
as he knew that passports were demanded from
every traveler stopping at an inn, they decided
to pass the night at a village yadoya, and proceed
to Hyogo on the following morning.</p>

<p>They found what they wanted two miles west
of Hyogo. After securing their rooms, they
had their bath, and ordered dinner. Presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
they heard the shrill voice of the landlady scolding
somebody roundly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You little lout&#8221; (hyakusho<a href="#A48">[48]</a>), she
shouted, &#8220;I sent you for fresh fish, and you
come back to tell me that there was none. No
fresh fish in Hyogo! Just think of it! And
here are two honorable gentlemen, who have
ordered their supper! You shall go right back,
you blockhead, and bring me fish, fresh fish, do
you hear?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano was amused, but Inouye whispered to
him, &#8220;Suppose we ask that little hyakusho to
find out if there is any ship sailing for Yedo.
Those little fellows who look so stupid, are
often keen enough, if they know that there is
some cash for them. Shall I see him?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano nodded assent, and Inouye descended
to the ground floor. The boy, a strong built
lad of fifteen or sixteen, was receiving the last
instructions, and Inouye strolled slowly on the
road toward Hyogo. He had not gone a hundred
yards, when he heard steps behind him,
and turning round saw the boy coming at a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
great pace. As the boy was about to pass him,
Inouye said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy stopped and bowed. Inouye continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;You are going to Hyogo, are you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy bowed again and muttered:&mdash;&#8220;I
am, your honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. My brother and myself are
stopping at yonder hotel. We have had a long
march and are tired, but we must go to Yedo as
soon as we can. Can you find out if any ships
are leaving, and if they take any passengers?
You are a sharp boy, and can find out if you try.
If you do your errand well, slip up-stairs so that
the landlady does not see it, and I shall pay you
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy looked up when he heard himself
called a sharp boy, and Inouye felt that he had
struck the right chord. He returned to the
yadoya, where he found Kano fast asleep. He,
too, stretched himself out upon the soft mats,
and closed his eyes.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>They awoke at the shuffling of feet, and the
noise of dishes being brought in. Both enjoyed
their supper. It was dark and the rain
doors had been closed; but they opened them
to enjoy the soft sea breeze. Neither of them
spoke, when a whisper came from under the
balcony: &#8220;Sir, sir, I have brought him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inouye recognized the boy&#8217;s voice. Quietly
measuring the height, he took one of the comforters
serving as bed, and fastening one end
to the railing swung himself over, holding the
other end in his hand. A man was standing
near the boy, and Inouye asked who he was.
The boy told him that he was a sendo. He
had found a ship that would leave for Tokyo at
dawn, and told her master that two gentlemen
at his inn wished to take passage. This sailor
had been ordered to show them the way, and to
carry their baggage.</p>

<p>Kano and Inouye were highly pleased. They
left enough money to pay their bill handsomely,
and, after Kano had joined his friend, rewarded
the boy. Preceded by the sendo, they made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
their way to Hyogo and reached the junk in
safety. They secured sleeping accommodations,
and when they awoke the following morning,
and went on deck, they saw that they had left
Hyogo far behind.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
<h2 class="nobreak">VIII<br />
YOKOHAMA IN 1859</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> junk had a fair voyage. The passengers
who had not been on the ocean
before, had suffered from seasickness,
but, since the junk generally followed the coast,
and often passed through smooth water, they
had quickly recovered. The voyage up Yedo
Bay had been very pleasant. But they met the
tide when they were off Kanagawa, and as there
was but little wind, the master had anchored.</p>

<p>If they had known it, they would have looked
behind them with some interest, for there was
the spot where Commodore Perry had anchored,
and with his fire ships, had battered down the
door of Japan&#8217;s isolation. That was five years
ago. These five years had brought serious
trouble upon their country, and there promised
to be graver disturbances; for, as there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
restlessness in their clan, so there was restlessness
everywhere.</p>

<p>As Kano stood thinking thus, he heard
Inouye ask the master of the junk how long it
would be before they reached Yedo. The answer
was that they must wait six hours before
the tide turned, and that then it would take
many hours unless the breeze freshened.
&#8220;But,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;if your honor is in a
hurry, I can call a sampan (row boat) and you
may be set ashore at Kanagawa. Then you
can follow the Tokaido, and reach Yedo to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano turned toward the master, and said
briefly: &#8220;Do so!&#8221; A little while after a sampan
passed within hailing distance, and soon the
two rônin were speeding toward the shore.</p>

<p>Kano and his friend made their way to a
quiet yadoya at Noge hill, where they could be
sure not to be disturbed by the trains of daimiyo
passing to and from the capital, and would
be free from impertinent questions. After they
had secured accommodations and refreshed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
themselves with a bath, they took their dinner.
Neither spoke of the subject uppermost in his
mind, their future plan of action. They were
now in the Tokugawa country, and every man
might be a spy. Besides, there was no privacy
in a house where the walls consisted of sho ji,
and even a whisper could be plainly heard in the
next room. Therefore, when they had finished
their dinner, Kano proposed a stroll. They
set forth, and walked in the direction of Yedo.
They were sure to be unobserved, since the
Tokaido was crowded with travelers of all
classes, and samurai were not likely to be questioned
after they had passed the barrier.</p>

<p>When they had reached a part of the road
where they could talk without danger of being
overheard, Kano said:</p>

<p>&#8220;We have arrived at the first stage of our
journey. Have you thought of any plan to
attain our end?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been thinking, of course,&#8221; replied
Inouye, &#8220;but I have no doubt that you have conceived
an excellent scheme.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>&#8220;No, I have not. Every plan I thought of,
when I came to work it out, offered some very
serious obstacle. I feel as if I am running my
head against a stone wall. We may go into
Yokohama, and if we are asked who we are, we
may answer that we are rônin. But if they ask
what we are doing, and we reply that we are
curious to see the barbarians, they will say:
Very well, you have seen them now, so you had
better go about your business. From that time
we shall be beset with spies, or we must leave.
This is a difficulty which I had not foreseen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your idea is to study the barbarians, is it
not?&#8221; said Inouye thoughtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Our clan must not act blindly. We
must know what is the purpose of those men
in coming here; but that is not all. We
must also know their strength and their weakness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is but one way in which that may be
done,&#8221; muttered Inouye, as if speaking to himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then that way must be chosen,&#8221; said Kano.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
&#8220;What is it? You do not hesitate on account
of the danger, I hope?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; but I do hesitate on account of the humiliation.
Look here, Mr. Kano, I will give you
my views frankly. If I were alone, that is, if
I had been commissioned by you, I would have
left my swords behind, and offered my services
to these barbarians in any capacity. I would
have entered into such employment as promised
the best opportunity to watch them when they
were among themselves and off their guard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how would you understand their
speech. You do not suppose that they converse
in our language, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Inouye, smiling, &#8220;but our
Japanese interpreters at Nagasaki tell me that
it does not take long to learn that tongue, and I
do not suppose that there is much difference in
the languages spoken by these barbarians.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Kano, &#8220;I admire your scheme
and like it. But such a step requires consideration.
Let us return to our yadoya and think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
it over. To-morrow morning we can decide
upon our future action.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they arrived in their room, the two
friends sat down before the hibachi, smoking
and sipping their tea. After some time Kano
stretched himself on the mats, and was soon
sound asleep. Inouye noiselessly opened a sho
ji and slipped through, closing it in the same
manner. He then went down to the lower
floor, and entered the front part of the house
which serves as office, kitchen, and as refreshment
hall for transient wayfarers of the poorer
class.</p>

<p>Here he found the landlord, squatting behind
his tiny desk. As Inouye approached, the landlord
bowed low, since, although the guest was
now dressed in kimono only, and had left his
swords up-stairs, he remembered having seen
him enter as a samurai. Inouye sat down
within easy reach of the landlord, and asked:
&#8220;How far is it from here to Yokohama?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That depends, your honor, upon the way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
you may choose. Across the new causeway it
is about two miles, but it is further by sampan.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are there any guards?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There were, your honor, but the barbarians
made so much fuss about them, that they were
withdrawn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then anybody may go in there without any
impertinent questions being asked?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, your honor. The barbarians do not
seem to care as to who comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I have been there twice. When the
first barbarians landed I thought that I would
go and see how they looked. I was disgusted!
Not one of them possessed any manners. They
shouted at the top of their voices, pushed and
crowded each other, and acted as if they were
possessed of demons. It was horrible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why did you go again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My little son was very sick, and some traveler
told me that these barbarians possessed
powerful charms. Every physician said that
the boy must die, and I thought that I would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
try to obtain a charm that would save the child&#8217;s
life. So I went to the gate at the causeway and
asked where I could purchase those charms. He
told me that he did not know, but when he knew
what I wanted them for, he advised me to go to
an American physician who lives in Kanagawa
near the causeway. I did so, and found him at
home. He was a tall, powerful man, but very
kind. There was a Japanese in his house who
could understand me, and when the physician
knew what was wanted, he and the Japanese
gentleman went with me. When we came home,
he asked some questions, examined the child
tenderly, and gave it some medicine. He and
his friend remained three hours, and only when
the child was sleeping peacefully, did he leave.
The next day he came again, and the next, and
the next, and now the child is as well as ever.
And he would not accept any money. All barbarians
are not bad men, that is sure, but most
of them are very rude.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know how they live in their
homes?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>&#8220;No. I have heard some young good-for-nothings
of this place who had served them as
kodz&#8217;kai<a href="#A49">[49]</a> (attendant, servant) speak about them,
but you can not believe what they say. Decent
men will not enter their service. Only a few
days ago the good physician asked me to get
him an honest man, but, although I have tried
hard and the wages are high, nobody cares to
take the risk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there any chance to secure work from
them in Yokohama?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! there is plenty of work, and the pay is
good. But our people do not like it much.
They have to work too hard. They are not allowed
to rest a minute, and when one of them
should smoke a pipe for a moment, and he is
seen, he receives his pay up to that time, and is
sent about his business. If they treat our people
in that manner, it will not be long before
they will have to do the work themselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inouye agreed with the landlord, and, while
that worthy was giving change to a servant
girl, he slipped up-stairs. He found Kano still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
asleep, and sat down before his hibachi thinking
deeply. There was absolute silence in the
room, save when he knocked the ashes out of
his pipe.</p>

<p>It was quite dark when Kano awoke.
&#8220;What, is it so late!&#8221; he said as he looked out
on the balcony, and saw the lights of the ships
in Yokohama harbor. &#8220;I thought I would
sleep for an hour or so, and here I have taken a
whole afternoon!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad of it,&#8221; replied Inouye. &#8220;After
supper we must stroll to the beach, for I have
much to tell you. I do not think that there will
be so very much difficulty in carrying out our
plans. But it is best not to speak of them
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano nodded, and clapped his hands as a
signal to serve up supper. They spoke about
the food, and joked with the servants. After
having satisfied their appetites, they strolled to
the beach.</p>

<p>It was a calm, bright night; the only noises
disturbing the almost oppressive silence, came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
from the ships in harbor, or from the shrill
whistle of the blind shampooer, as he offered
his services in the way peculiar to that trade.
Kano led the way until they came to a little
hillock where they could notice the approach of
strangers. He sat down, and courteously motioned
Inouye to take a seat by his side. Inouye
did so, and at Kano&#8217;s request related his conversation
with their landlord.</p>

<p>He then suggested that Kano should apply
for the position of house servant of the barbarian
physician, while he, Inouye, would try
to secure work at Yokohama. But Kano would
not hear of this. &#8220;No!&#8221; he said. &#8220;This
physician seems to be a good man; you must go
there, and I shall mingle with those rude people
at Yokohama. But on ichi-roku nichi<a href="#A50">[50]</a> we
must meet here at eight o&#8217;clock, and communicate
each other&#8217;s experiences. But what shall
we do with our swords? They would betray
us at once?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That, certainly, is a difficulty, but not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
serious one. Let us think it over, we are sure
to find some way out of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two samurai then returned to their inn
and retired.</p>

NEW EXPERIENCE</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap2"><span class="smcap">After</span> eating their breakfast at an early
hour on the following morning,
Inouye went down stairs in search of
the landlord. He found him sitting at his desk,
as if he had not left it since their last conversation.
He called for the bill, and gave such a
generous tip that the landlord was highly
pleased, and showed it by his repeated and
humble bows. Inouye made a suitable reply,
and then said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Landlord, I have spoken with my elder
brother about what you told me yesterday.
The Go rojiu is anxious that some of our young
men should learn the barbarian language, and
we came here to look for the best ways and
means, for it was decided in our family that I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
should try. It seems to me that the easiest way
would be to live with them, and after what you
have told me about the physician, I think I
would like to serve him, and my brother agrees
with me. Now, it does not matter who we are,
but I am no good-for-nothing, and shall do my
duty. For the present my name is Tomori, and
I ask you if you will direct me to this physician?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall do better than that,&#8221; replied the landlord.
He clapped his hands, and when a servant
appeared, he told him to bring OKichi<a href="#A51">[51]</a>
San. Soon after the Honorable Master Kichi
appeared. &#8220;Honorable Master Kichi,&#8221; said
his father to the eight year old urchin, &#8220;take
this gentleman to the house of the American
physician.&#8221; Kichi bowed, and leading the way,
brought Inouye to a private house, off the
Tokaido and near the causeway leading to
Yokohama. There was a small but well kept
garden in front. It was a house which had
evidently been built for a well-to-do samurai,
but Inouye noticed that the sho ji, instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
being of paper, were of a transparent substance,
probably glass.</p>

<p>Kichi pulled the rope of a gong, the sound of
which brought a pleasant looking Japanese gentleman
to the door.</p>

<p>Inouye bowed, and his salute was returned in
the same ceremonious manner. He then asked
if he could see the barbarian physician. &#8220;I am
sorry,&#8221; said the other, &#8220;but he is out. He will
be back very soon, I think; be pleased to enter.&#8221;
He showed Inouye the way to a back room,
with tatami<a href="#A52">[52]</a> on the floor, and, after repeating
the salutations, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope that it is not on account of illness
that you wish to see the physician?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; replied Inouye. &#8220;I shall tell you
frankly what brings me here, for I hope to secure
your valuable assistance. I have always
had a love for books and knowledge, and am
very anxious to study foreign languages. I
consulted my elder brother, and we came to
Kanagawa together. At the inn we heard how
kindly this physician had treated our host, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
also that he is in need of a servant. My
brother and I thought that if my services were
acceptable, I should offer them such as they
are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not a Tokugawa man, I fancy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should I not be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because your speech savors from the
south,&#8221; was the answer. &#8220;I did not ask you
that question from motives of curiosity, but because
most of the men who enter into the service
of foreigners, are such as are bound to find their
way to jail. Every foreigner prefers any servant
to one from this neighborhood. What name
do you wish to go by? I hear the physician&#8217;s
footstep, and will speak to him at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>He left the room, but returned quickly, preceded
by a bearded man in the full vigor of life.
Inouye prostrated himself before the stranger,
who said in Japanese which sounded quaint
although quite intelligible:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Tanaka tells me that you wish to enter
my service, and I am willing to try you. You
are expected to be here from seven in the morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
until nine in the evening, and will receive a
salary of five riyo.<a href="#A53">[53]</a> You shall have a room,
which Mr. Tanaka will show you, and you can
share the meals with the other servants. If
you need anything, ask Mr. Tanaka; or if you
want to speak to me, come to my room. I shall
expect you to-morrow morning; you can now
go and bring here what you may have as baggage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inouye prostrated himself again. Tanaka
then showed him his room, which was in one
of the outhouses, but far more pleasant than
his own quarters in Choshiu. Everything was
clean. He was then taken to the room where
the servants took their meals, and to the bathroom
reserved for them. At last Tanaka told
him that he could take possession at any time
during that day, so as to feel more at home
when his duties should commence.</p>

<p>When he had left the physician&#8217;s house,
Inouye hastened back to the inn. He was dazed
and did not know what to think. He would
tell his new experience to Kano and consult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
with him. He entered the yadoya, and, answering
the smiling landlord&#8217;s humble welcome
with a slight bow, he hurried up-stairs. Kano
was evidently expecting him, but showed not
the least sign of curiosity. Both saluted as became
samurai, and upon Kano&#8217;s invitation,
Inouye sat down and lit his pipe, waiting for
Kano to speak first.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you succeeded?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When will you enter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have agreed to begin to-morrow morning,
but I can occupy my room to-day, and bring in
my baggage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you had better make some purchases.
Here are a hundred riyo. Nay, do not hesitate,&#8221;
for Inouye was surprised at such a large sum
being offered to him, &#8220;for your work is of great
value to the clan, and you may need it; something
may occur, or you may be suspected, and
Choshiu can not afford to lose so worthy a
samurai as my young friend Inouye has proved
to be.&#8221; Inouye bowed low, to hide his confusion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
It was so rare that a samurai of Kano&#8217;s
rank bestowed praise that Inouye was deeply
moved. Kano pretended not to notice the emotion,
and continued: &#8220;While you are making
your purchases after dinner, I shall go to Yokohama
and see what success I may achieve. But
what shall we do with our swords?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could take them with me to the physician&#8217;s
house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. You will wait here for me until
I return?&#8221;</p>

<p>Inouye bowed assent. Dinner was ordered
and brought up; after it was eaten, the two left
the house, barefooted and in simple cotton kimono.
They went together as far as the Tokaido,
where Inouye pointed out the physician&#8217;s
residence. Kano noticed it closely. They then
parted, Inouye turning to the left to visit the
stores, while Kano descended to the causeway,
and followed it toward Yokohama.</p>

<p>It was six o&#8217;clock before he returned. Inouye
had noticed that Kano had avoided asking for
particulars. He, as younger in years, and less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
high in rank, would have committed a severe
breach of good breeding amounting to a crime,
if he had asked a question except in explanation.
The same ceremonious salutations took place,
and supper was ordered. After it was over,
Kano said:</p>

<p>&#8220;We are now about to part. I am to begin
to work to-morrow as a ninzoku.<a href="#A54">[54]</a> I have
been engaged by a fellow, a Japanese, who will
have a taste of the lash before I am entirely
through with him.&#8221; The false smile and suppressed
emotion with which this was hissed out
between his lips, proved how pitilessly in earnest
he was. &#8220;But we shall reserve our observations
for a month from now. We meet
every fifth day, as we agreed yesterday. Here
are my swords,&#8221; saluting reverently as he
handed them to his companion, who received
them with marks of even greater reverence.</p>

<p>Inouye concealed the swords, with his own,
among his clothes. He then took the bundle
to the door. Here he turned round, and prostrating
himself, bent his head three times upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
his outstretched hands. Then, rising, he bowed
once more, drawing in his breath. Kano replied
in the same manner. Not another word
was said, and Inouye carried his bundle to the
scene of a new life.</p>

<p>Kano remained alone, deeply buried in
thought. Not the slightest token of emotion
was visible, yet the man was terribly wroth.
His long-practised self control enabled him to
conceal the passion he felt by that stolid look of
contemplation which completely veils the
thoughts. He sat motionless, regardless of the
time, mechanically answering the servant who
arranged the comforters for his couch. The
streets were silent, the yadoya had closed up for
the night, and still Kano was sitting there motionless
as a statue. Midnight was past, when
he felt for his tobacco pouch. Stirring up the
few sparks in the hibachi with the chopstick-like
brass tongs, he took a few whiffs at his pipe,
and then, confident that he had schooled himself
for the coming ordeal, he lay down upon his
couch.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">X<br />
FRIENDSHIP OR HATRED?</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Six</span> weeks had passed. It was in the evening
after supper, when three samurai
were sitting in the room overlooking the
garden of Choshiu&#8217;s yashiki in Yedo. Guards
were stationed within easy distance, so as to
encircle the principal building, one room of
which was occupied by Kano, in virtue of his
influence within the clan. It was known that
the Go rojiu had scattered more spies about the
yashiki of the great southern clans. Kano, who,
had arrived only that morning, had immediately
ordered the captain of the guard, to produce a
list of every person living within the yashiki or
its grounds. Together they had scanned every
name, and those who were not personally known
to the Councillor or the Captain, were served
with a notice to depart, and had been escorted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
the gate. Kano had also given orders that a
report should be prepared at once, explaining
who was responsible for their presence. Until
this had been sifted to the bottom, a number of
young samurai of known loyalty had been selected
to guard the palace, in turn, and they had
received orders to cut down any one found
prowling in the grounds. A search was made
under the palace, and it was only when satisfied
that floor nor ceiling had been tampered with,
that Kano felt he could speak without fear of
being reported.</p>

<p>After he was satisfied of his privacy, he had
sent word to the guard at the gate that, when
Mr. Inouye should arrive, he was to proceed
immediately to the palace. The answer was
that Inouye was in the yashiki, and in the apartments
of Mr. Ito. Kano had then sent a request
to the two friends to visit him in his room.
They had returned with the messenger, and had
taken supper together. The servants had
brought tea and tobacco, and had been dismissed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; said Kano, &#8220;we shall now proceed
to business. Mr. Ito, your friend has
probably informed you of what has brought
him to Yedo?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beyond mentioning incidentally that his
visit was connected with business of the clan,
he has not done so, your honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is entirely like <i>my friend</i> Inouye. It
was like a true samurai, although, in this case,
so much caution was superfluous. I am, however,
pleased, because I shall have the satisfaction
of enlarging upon the merits of our friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inouye bowed to the ground, and protested
that he had only acted as every samurai of
Choshiu would have done. Kano then proceeded
to unfold the events leading to their mission,
and their adventures, until the time when
they entered upon their novel experiences, while
Ito, although deeply interested and astonished,
preserved the same placid countenance. Kano
continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;We met, as agreed upon, every fifth day.
It was, I confess, a relief to me to see a face I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
could trust, but I would not permit our friend
to tell me his experience. It was because I
desired facts, and not mere impressions. The
investigation regarded the welfare of the clan,
hence, of course, no sacrifice could be too great.
Above all, the council desired impartial accounts;
justice, full justice, must be done to the
barbarians and to the Tokugawa, and that the
judgment might be unbiassed, time nor expense
should be taken into account. I am, even
now, sorry that an accident drew the attention
of the Tokugawa spies upon me, and compelled
me to leave suddenly. It was not difficult to
baffle those dogs, and I am quite sure that they
lost all traces of me. They are probably burying
my body now. It was owing to my supposed
death that I could warn our friend here,
who will now, I am sure, entertain us with his
experience.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inouye bowed and said: &#8220;If I had been permitted
to give your honor my impressions,
when I was first engaged by that <i>good</i> man, the
American physician, they would not vary materially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
from what I can now state as my knowledge.
From first to last, he and his family
treated me with the greatest kindness. I was
known to him as Tomori, the kodz&#8217;kai; yet
when he <i>requested</i> me to do something, it was
always with a &#8216;please!&#8217; and he invariably
thanked me. He observed that I was anxious
to acquire his language, perhaps Mr. Tanaka,
his interpreter, had told him so. The first day,
when the work was done, he sent for me, and,
taking a book from his shelves, began to teach
me. Thanks to his patience, I can now fairly
read and speak his language.</p>

<p>&#8220;The work was light; to be sure, it was not
the work of a samurai, but I was not made to
feel that I was a menial. At first I was shocked
when I saw that his wife was really the master
in the house, and that he paid her marked deference
whenever they met. They ate together
and walked out together. But I found out very
quickly that, while she directed the affairs of the
household, and looked after the children, she did
not interfere with his work, except to help him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
She looked after all of us, to see that we were
made comfortable, and often, when my morning&#8217;s
work was finished, she would say: &#8216;Tomori
San, bring your books; perhaps I may be
able to help you.&#8217; Truly, she is a good woman,
as her husband is a good man.</p>

<p>&#8220;Everybody in the house was required to
come in the dining-room, in the morning before
breakfast, and in the evening after supper.
When Tanaka came for me the first morning,
and I asked him what this meant, he only
smiled, and told me to ask again, in about two
weeks. I thought it was part of my duty, and,
of course, I went. I watched Tanaka, and did
as he did. We sat down, and the physician
read to us in his own language; what it was, I
could not understand. Then they all fell on
their knees, while he spoke aloud; at last, he
and his family sang, and then we were dismissed.
I saw that Tanaka was unwilling to
explain, and did not press him. In about two
weeks I began to understand some of the words,
and then it dawned upon me with horror, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
this physician belonged to the jashui mono,<a href="#A55">[55]</a>
the corrupt sect. Then I remembered the edict
of Iyeyasu<a href="#A56">[56]</a>:&mdash;&#8216;The Christians have come to
Japan to disseminate an evil law, to overthrow
right doctrine, so that they may change the government
of the country and obtain possession
of the land. If they are not prohibited, the
safety of the state will surely be imperiled; and
if those charged with the government of the
nation do not extirpate the evil, they will expose
themselves to Heaven&#8217;s rebuke.&#8217; I was
horror-struck, and felt that, indeed, I was running
in danger for the sake of the clan. But
that same thought calmed me. What was the
danger compared to the clan. And as I grew
calmer, I remembered that I did not see any
crosses, and that the priests of Iyeyasu&#8217;s time
were not permitted to marry. Still, as my
duty permitted me to go into any room, at any
time of the day or evening, I watched the physician,
his wife and children so closely that they
could do nothing without it being known to me.
I had my pains for my trouble. I discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
nothing, because there was nothing concealed.
I kept watching, I never relaxed until the time
I left, because it was my duty to the clan. I
have since discovered that the physician and his
wife are Christians, but surely there has been
either a terrible mistake made, or there are two
sorts of Christians. At any rate, they do not
belong to any corrupt sect.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will now sum up my experience. I have
learned their language to a considerable extent.
I have learned that there are many foreign
nations, differing in language, habits, customs,
as much as we differ from those of China
and Korea. I have also received from the
physician a book which gives the size of each
country, the population, the army, navy, and a
great many other interesting facts; but I would
doubt its accuracy, only the physician tells me
that it is very nearly correct. What made me
doubt is that, in referring to Dai Nippon,
which they called Japan, it is stated that we
have two emperors, one spiritual and one temporal,
whom they name Tai Kun.<a href="#A57">[57]</a> When I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
showed this to the physician, he smiled, and
said that it was our fault that foreigners knew
so little of our country, because we had never
permitted them to come and enjoy its beauty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inouye then produced one of the large geographies
used in our schools. He showed them
the map of the world, and the size of Japan
compared with that of other nations. The map
of the United States was closely examined, as
well as that of the ocean which separates it
from Japan. All this was new to Kano and
Ito, and both were absorbed in the subject.
Inouye explained as much as his limited knowledge
of English would permit; although his
progress in that language, considering the time
he had been able to devote to its study, was
simply marvelous. At last Kano requested
Inouye to put the book up until some other opportunity.
The geography was then carefully
wrapped up in cotton, and again in embroidered
silk, showing the great value attached to it.
Both Kano and Ito asked minutely about the
daily life of the physician, whom they did no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
longer mention as &#8220;barbarian,&#8221; but Oisha-san,<a href="#A58">[58]</a>
Honorable Mr. Physician, a token of the
favorable impression made upon them by
Inouye&#8217;s simple account. All these questions
were answered promptly, and it was past midnight
when Kano broke up the meeting with the
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, this has been a very pleasant
evening to me, none the less because I am surprised.
My experience is very different from
that of Mr. Inouye. I intended to give it to
you this evening, but he has beguiled us with
his interesting account. The clan will appreciate
what he has done: the knowledge he has
acquired will be of great usefulness, and his
loyalty to the clan deserves recognition.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano called a guard to conduct the two
friends to their quarters, and all retired to rest.</p>

CHOSHIU&#8217;S YASHIKI</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> next morning had been a busy one
for Kano. All the officers of the clan,
entitled to the privilege, had called to
pay their respects. It was eleven o&#8217;clock when
the Commandant requested an audience. He
was admitted, and reported that the evening before
one of the younger samurai, returning
home from a visit to a Tosa friend, had been
grossly insulted by two men; that he had drawn
his sword and had killed one and seriously
wounded the other. The affair had taken place
not far from the yashiki, and the captain of the
guard had despatched some men to the scene.
The wounded man was carried in and had since
died. He bore the Tokugawa crest, and a letter
addressed to the Go rojiu was found upon him.
The Commandant delivered the letter, and asked
what was to be done.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>Kano had listened with little interest, only
ejaculating sometimes a polite nara hudo!<a href="#A59">[59]</a> to
show that he was listening. When he read the
inscription,&mdash;the name of the sender is always
upon the address of a letter,&mdash;there was no
longer lack of interest. It was from Sawa!
Was it a trap or was it fate? His questions
showed the importance of the case.</p>

<p>Had the samurai been placed under arrest?</p>

<p>Certainly.</p>

<p>Who is he? &#8217;Hm! a man above reproach.</p>

<p>What are his habits? Regular? Very
well, but let him be closely investigated. Enjoin
the strictest silence upon the guard. Let the
body be placed in a coffin, ready for funeral.
Was the man&#8217;s comrade dead? That was ascertained?
Very well. The matter would be
duly considered, and instructions would follow
in due time.</p>

<p>Kano was toying with the letter. What
should he do? This was a business that must
be decided by the Council of the Clan. But
who constituted the council? Kano smiled, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
he was alone. Hattori and himself. Hattori
had his own opinions&mdash;until he was made acquainted
with those of Kano. That was all
true, but this was a matter of life and death, and
Kano hesitated. Suddenly a thought struck
him. &#8220;Yes,&#8221; he thought, &#8220;that young man
has brains, and thinks for himself; he is the man
I need.&#8221; He clapped his hands, and when the
attendant appeared, desired him to invite Mr.
Inouye to call at once, and that his friend Mr.
Ito should favor him with a visit after dinner.</p>

<p>He had not long to wait before Inouye appeared.
Kano at once invited him to enter, and
at once told him of the fight and the difficulty
it involved. Inouye&#8217;s face was expressionless,
but when Kano asked him what he would do
in this case, he inquired:</p>

<p>&#8220;Has your honor examined the samurai?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano replied by requesting him to act as secretary,
and together they repaired to the Commandant&#8217;s
quarters. Writing materials were
brought, and the prisoner entered.</p>

<p>He was a manly youth, twenty or twenty-two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
years old. He prostrated himself before the
councillor, and, upon being told to give an account
of the affair, he told simply that he had
applied for and received a pass from the Commandant
to visit a friend in the Tosa yashiki.
That he had returned home by way of the inner
castle wall, and, after crossing the bridge, two
samurai had purposely run against him, and
called him a lout. He had demanded an apology,
whereupon one of them had ordered him upon
his knees. At that insult he had drawn his
sword, and had duly punished the insolent braggards.
He had then returned home, and reported
the affair to the Commandant.</p>

<p>Kano had the prisoner removed, but when
the Commandant reported that he was of exemplary
antecedents and conduct, he was
brought in again, and, after exhorting him to
keep silence, he was commended for his courage
and discharged. The Councillor gave orders to
have the body cremated, and returned with
Inouye to the Palace.</p>

<p>They had dinner together, and after the room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
had been cleared, and the servants withdrawn,
Kano deliberately opened the letter, and read it.
He then handed it over to Inouye, who also
read it carefully, returning it to Kano, who
said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It seems that we must return to Nagato.
Sawa&#8217;s conscience begins to prick him unless
the council has stopped his supply of money, or
he has been reproved by the Go rojiu. He says
in his letter that it is said that I am ill, but that
he does not quite believe it. Well, as soon as I
get back, I shall invite him to call, and scold him
roundly for neglecting me so long. That, and
a few hundred riyo, will appease his tender conscience.
I wish I could sweep the whole Tokugawa
breed from the soil of Dai Nippon! Ah!
here is your friend Ito!&#8221;</p>

<p>As soon as the expected guest was seated
Kano said:</p>

<p>&#8220;It is now my turn, gentlemen, to go over
my experiences with the foreign devils. Mr.
Inouye will remember how I went to Yokohama
in search of work. When I arrived, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
entered a tea house, and after taking a cup or
two, inquired where I might get work. I was
directed to the hatoba,<a href="#A60">[60]</a> where I found a number
of ninzoku, moving cases and bales. I
asked of one of them who was their employer.
He rudely pointed to a man of about my own
height, who was scribbling in a book. I went
to this person, and offered my services. The
rude dog said curtly:&mdash;&#8216;Wait!&#8217; I tell you,
gentlemen, it was well that I had left my swords
behind, for I came very near forgetting myself;
as it was, my palms itched. The people close
by seemed accustomed to this sort of treatment,
for no one paid attention, except one who looked
at me curiously for a moment. After about
five minutes, the fellow came up to me, looked
me over as you would look over a horse you
wished to buy, and then said curtly: &#8216;Come to-morrow
at seven. If you are late, you need not
come at all,&#8217; I said nothing, but promised to
teach that fellow manners, before we parted
finally. Nevertheless, I was on hand in time
the next morning and enjoyed some very wholesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
muscular exercise. It was then that I
had occasion to notice the first foreign devil.
He was a tall and well-built man with reddish
hair and beard, and walked as if the earth belonged
to him. A small coolie was in his way,
and he lifted his foot, and kicked, actually
kicked, that poor fellow out of his way. I
jumped up as if I had been struck myself, when
the same man who had looked so oddly at me
the day before, seized me by the girdle, and
without looking up, whispered:&mdash;&#8216;You are forgetting
your purpose!&#8217; He was right, and
brought me to my senses. Well, gentlemen,
that day I saw Japanese wantonly struck and
knocked down, without any provocation whatever,
by several of those foreign devils. At
noon most of the coolies ate their lunch where
they worked, but the man who had spoken to
me came up and said: &#8216;There is a small
yadoya close by, shall I show you the way?&#8217;
I thanked him, and followed. I secured a room
and was back in time to train my muscles into
whipcord.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>&#8220;When evening came, I went back to the
yadoya, and after taking my bath, had supper.
I must say that I enjoyed both more than I ever
had before. I was about to lie down, when I
remembered that I had not thanked my unknown
friend, who decidedly was not what he
seemed. I was going down to ask the landlord
if he knew him, when I saw him standing
in the door. He motioned to follow him; so,
securing a lantern from the landlord, I did so.
He led the way past many houses built of
stone, to a creek. There was a rude bridge,
leading to a path ascending to the hills. At
the crest he stopped and waited. We were at
a point where nobody could approach us unobserved,
and he bowed as only gentlemen do.
Of course, I returned the salute in the same
manner. He then said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Disguise between you and me is useless.
Down below there, I am Eto,<a href="#A61">[61]</a> a ninzoku; here
I am Teraji,<a href="#A62">[62]</a> a Satsuma samurai, at your
service.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not yet decided what I am down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
below,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;but at this moment I am
Kano of Choshiu, very glad to acknowledge
the service rendered to me by the Honorable
Teraji of Satsuma.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh! that is nothing. The situation <i>is</i>
sometimes a little awkward. I understood your
feeling, and was on the lookout. These foreign
devils <i>are</i> brutal, but it is their nature, I
suppose, and they can not help it. But I grieve
to notice that this sort of conduct renders our
people, who come in contact with them, brutish.
They lose all respect for authority and the
Tokugawa, or whoever succeeds them in
power, is going to have trouble with this class
of people.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;You do not mean to say that the ninzoku
are deficient in respect to our authorities?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;If they are not yet, they are rapidly growing
so. You will notice it yourself. At the
same time, you will observe that there is a very
great difference among the foreigners. While
none of them possess the breeding of a gentleman,
there are some naturally wicked, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
others have a kindlier disposition. I do not
believe that there are many who like to inflict
pain. It is easy to perceive that none of them
have learned self-restraint, but that they are
all under the influence of the passion of the moment.
The brute who kicked that poor ninzoku
for instance. He was in a hurry, and it was
less trouble for him to reach his destination
by making room for himself in this manner,
than to wait until the coolie could make room
for him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;What astonished me is that the ninzoku
took the attack without resenting it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Well, there are two reasons. Some did
resent it at first, but these foreigners are trained
to use their fists, and, man for man, our people
have no chance. But wait until the coolies
grow acquainted. At present they are from
the poorest and most thriftless classes of all
parts of Japan. Soon, however, they will all be
residents of Yokohama, and then they will form
into a union. When that time comes I will
venture to say that there will be few foreigners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
who will dare use either fists or feet. But it is
getting late. To-morrow we do not work.
Every seventh day, the foreigners have a holiday,
and we shall be able to take a long walk.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;We returned to the inn, and parted at the
door with a boorish bow. That was the extent
of my experience on the first day. It was
enough to supply me with food for thought.&#8221;</p>

SONNO-JOI</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Kano</span> rose slowly and left the room.
When he returned after a brief absence,
he was in kamishimo,<a href="#A63">[63]</a> a white
or hemp-colored dress used only upon the most
solemn occasions. He sat down between the
two friends, who, astonished as they felt, maintained
the same impressive countenance. After
thinking for a few minutes, which to Ito and
Inouye seemed an age, he resumed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_118f.jpg" alt="HE WAS IN KAMISHIMO" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;HE WAS IN KAMISHIMO.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen, Mr. Teraji and myself have
given the barbarians a fair trial, and we have
come to the conclusion that they are not wanted
in this fair land of ours. We do not believe
that they have any other object in view except
trade, but whether they have or not, it is immaterial:
they must be expelled. It is the
duty of the Shogun to do this, and, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
Iyeyasu or Iyemitsu living, I have no doubt the
Tokugawa clan would be quite able to accomplish
the work in such a manner that the barbarians
would think twice before they returned
to these shores. Unfortunately, the long peace
we have had, has exercised a bad influence
upon the Shogun and the clan. Gentlemen, I
must trust you entirely. There can be no doubt
of the loyalty of Kano to the house of Mori,
and yet I dare not repeat, even to my old friend
Hattori, what I am about to say to you now.
You notice my dress? I put it on because,
unless you agree with me, I shall commit seppuku.<a href="#A64">[64]</a>
But pray, give me your close attention.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is said, at Nagato, that Kano governs
the Choshiu clan, and, in the main it is true,
although the other councillors are always consulted.
But our Lord Mori is not. He does
not know any more about the affairs of the clan,
than the ordinary samurai. He is a brave,
kind gentleman, who would lead his clan into
battle, or commit seppuku, as well as the bravest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
among us. But he has been trained to have
others think for him, and provide for all his
wants. That is all very well, so long as peace
reigns, and in a small territory like Choshiu.
But the same rule prevails in every clan, and
not only there, but in the Yedo government.
The last Shogun were children, and died young.
Iyesáda,<a href="#A65">[65]</a> the present Shogun, is only a boy.
The government is, therefore, conducted by the
Go rojiu, and the regent. Ii Naosuke occupies
the same position which I hold in our clan.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know him, but from what I hear,
he has brains and courage. He is entitled to
those qualities, for his ancestor was one of
Iyeyasu&#8217;s most trusted captains. Yet he has
granted all that the barbarians demanded. It
has puzzled me, and is puzzling me still, why
he did so. Teraji told me that these barbarians
had defeated the flower of China&#8217;s army, and
were ready to throw their hosts upon these
shores. But the 80,000 samurai of the Tokugawa
clans should be strong enough to prevent
any army from landing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>&#8220;I remember, however, what Mr. Ito told
me about the Tokugawa samurai, and my own
observation has confirmed his opinion. They
are worthless, and a disgrace to us. Why,
look at that fellow whose body was cremated
yesterday but which should have been thrown
to the dogs. He was intrusted with a dispatch,
yet engaged in a brawl before executing his
commission. Such a man is unworthy of being
a samurai. Ii Naosuke must have known
this, and submitted out of loyalty to the descendant
of Iyeyasu. He, too, labors under
great difficulties. The Tokugawa family is divided.
Mito,<a href="#A66">[66]</a> notwithstanding his ancestor&#8217;s
will, hopes to see one of his sons succeed as
Shogun. If, then, the barbarians must be expelled,
it is not the Tokugawa who are able to
do it, and therefore that family must be deprived
of their power.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the first step. It will take, however,
the united efforts of several clans to accomplish
it, and the question is: Can a sufficient
number of clans be brought to do the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
work without jealousy. I think not, unless we
can secure the person of Tenshi Sama and
thereby use his seal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Ito and Inouye, trained in self-control
as they were, could not help giving a start.
Kano did not seem to notice it, and continued:</p>

<p>&#8220;The seal of Tenshi Sama will be obeyed by
every clan. The Regent knows that, and has
applied to Kyoto to have the treaties confirmed.
Happily, there are some among the Kugé,<a href="#A67">[67]</a>
who do not want Tenshi Sama to be mixed up
in this matter. They have replied that &#8216;if there
must be treaties with the barbarians, the Go
rojiu must see to it that they are admitted into
the vicinity of Kyoto.&#8217; Therefore, the Regent
is sorely disappointed. No doubt, he will make
further efforts. But some of us must enter
into communication with some Kugé, and prevent
his success; and, if there is any possibility
of securing possession of the Gosho,<a href="#A68">[68]</a> it must
be done.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can not confide our plans to other
clans. They would think at once that Choshiu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
wishes to succeed Tokugawa. Perhaps it does.
All we do know is that Iyeyasu, who humbled
the proudest clan, humbly begged Tenshi Sama
to appoint him as Shogun. If he had not possessed
the imperial authority, not even he could
have prevented constant revolts. But he did
possess it, and that is why my ancestor advised
his lord not to join the insurgents. It may be,
however, that the time has come to wipe out
the clan&#8217;s disgrace, and my ancestor&#8217;s death.
If so, let Tokugawa look to it! That proud
clan shall feel what it is when the hand of the
despoiler wields a conqueror&#8217;s magic wand.
Now, gentlemen, I have given you my opinion,
and if I have spoken treason, I shall expiate my
sin at once and in your presence, that no taint
may rest upon my son. If, on the contrary,
you agree with me, I need all the help that your
devotion to the clan can offer. But perhaps
you would like to ask any questions?&#8221;</p>

<p>Inouye waited for Ito to speak, but when he
perceived his friend to be buried in thought, he
said:&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>&#8220;Perhaps your honor may be willing to explain
what caused your hurried departure from
Yokohama, and why I was ordered to resign
at a minute&#8217;s notice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Teraji was to blame for it,&#8221; replied Kano,
&#8220;although I share in the blame. A boy committed
an error in piling up cases to be loaded
in a ship, and was brutally maltreated by the
master. Sorely hurt, he was unable to go on
with his work, when the Japanese who engaged
me, after ridiculing the lad, gave him such a
push that the lad fell and broke his leg. It happened
just before the time when we were dismissed
for the day, and I found Teraji waiting
for me. He told me that he wished to speak
to me right after supper, and I knew at once
that my sword would be required. So I hastened
to Kanagawa, and had no difficulty in
securing speech with you. After you had given
me my swords, I told you to be at our yashiki
here the next day, and returned to the yadoya,
where I found Teraji, standing motionless in
the shadow of a house. He too, had buckled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
on his swords, and I scarcely recognized the
former ninzoku. We saluted as became gentlemen,
and he told me that he was waiting for
a messenger. It was almost midnight when a
boy appeared, and after looking first at me and
then at him, beckoned us to follow. In one of
the new streets we saw the master of the ship
staggering home. Teraji followed him as a
cat steals up to a mouse, crouching, ready for
the spring. And as he did leap, out flashed his
sword. Satsuma has lost neither nerve nor
muscle. There was one barbarian less, gentlemen,
and as Teraji wiped his sword upon the
clothes of the dog, he said: &#8216;Now let us begone.&#8217;
&#8216;No, not yet,&#8217; said I. This time I took
the lead to the house of the Japanese brute. I
disliked to soil my dagger in the scoundrel&#8217;s
dirty blood, but I desired to avoid an outcry.
When we came to his house, I called him and
told him he was wanted at the hatoba. He did
not hesitate. We took him through the street
where the master still lay, and when he bent
over to see who it was, I took care that he did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
not get up again. When we examined him to
see if he was dead, Teraji exclaimed at the
likeness with me. To make it appear more
so, he helped me to exchange kimono, then I
gave a few cuts in his face, and we left him.
We made our way unobserved into Kanagawa,
and from there to Yedo. Teraji went to Satsuma&#8217;s
yashiki and I arrived here, wholly unobserved,
I am sure. I had some little difficulty
in convincing our worthy commandant of my
identity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then your honor thinks that there is no
suspicion among the metsuke of your being
here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think not.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What orders does it please your honor to
give us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you agree with me that I am right.
That is well. Now, gentlemen, this may cost
your lives. The clan must not be compromised.
Mr. Inouye has written his resignation, you
Mr. Ito must do the same. Inouye must go to
Kyoto, and enter into communication with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
Gosho. I shall join him there, after I have
shown myself to the clan, and given the necessary
instructions to my friend Hattori. You,
Ito, must visit the clans, as a rônin. Do not
spare money. Entertain freely. Tell every
samurai who is willing to listen of how the
barbarians are desecrating the land of the gods.
Be prudent, but raise the battle-cry of Sonno-Joï<a href="#A69">[69]</a>;
Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarian!
That cry must be heard from Hokaido
to Kiu-siu. Yours will not be a difficult task.
Our young samurai, except those Tokugawa
she-monkeys,<a href="#A70">[70]</a> are anxious enough to test their
blades. You will find many of them willing to
provoke a war. Direct them to Kyoto. It
will need a very strong cry to awaken the court
to action, after its centuries of sleep. But do
not supply them with money. We do not want
any hirelings within our ranks, we need patriots.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ito bowed, and said thoughtfully: &#8220;Your
honor is right in saying that mine is an easy
task. There will be no difficulty in raising the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
cry of Sonno-Joï, nor in getting brawny arms
to clasp the hilt of the sword. But who shall
stifle the cry or sheath the blades, after they
have served the purpose? I have heard of little
boys, in the mountains of the north, starting
a snowball down the hill; and when it did come
down, a whole village lay buried.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is so,&#8221; replied Kano. &#8220;But our country
has never in vain called for men to guide it
in time of danger, nor will it now. One or two
clans are powerless to preserve it from the barbarians,
but all the clans united, are invincible.
Here is an order upon the treasurer. Take an
ample supply of money, for you will need it.
When will you be ready to start?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As soon as your honor commands,&#8221; replied
Ito bowing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do so, then, as soon as possible. Mr.
Inouye will keep me company as far as Hyogo.
I have a passage engaged by a ship leaving to-morrow.
In all our actions let us never forget
our motto: Sonno-Joï, Revere the Emperor,
Expel the Foreigner!&#8221;</p>

PLOTTING</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Two</span> men, dressed in kimono, haori, and
hakama were sitting in one of the numerous
temples which add to the natural
beauty of the old imperial capital of Japan.
The noon meal was over, but neither had an
eye for the glorious landscape spread out before
them. To the right and left a wave of mountains
seemed to roll up in ever increasing
height, until those in the background pierced
the deep-blue sky. The hills about the city were
clad in a mantle of green of every shade, from
the dark needles of the fir to the light shoots
of the bamboo. Crag and cliff bore the crimson
torii, the unique indication of the proximity
of temple or shrine. Yonder, at their feet, lay
the holy of holiest, the Gosho, the residence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Tenshi Sama, the representative of the Yamato
Damashii,<a href="#A71">[71]</a> the fierce Spirit of Old Japan. A
fierce spirit! Men trained to consider duty the
sole motive, reckless of pain, and inured to the
sight of blood, are not sparing of that precious
fluid when they are bent upon the execution of
a purpose. Yet the recluse yonder, the very
incarnation of that spirit, dwelling in the temple-like
building surrounded by enchanted gardens,
seemed unconscious of his power to stir
millions of brave men into action, by a mere
use of his seal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then his lordship thinks that it can be
done?&#8221; asked Inouye, for he was one of the
occupants of the room.</p>

<p>The man thus addressed, bowed low, and
said:&mdash;&#8220;My master has sent your honor a
haori with his crest. I passed through the
gate, and left my name ticket; then pretending
that I had forgotten something, went in again,
and when I came out I deposited the ticket of
Mr. Kida, a distant relative, who was admitted
in the service of my master. It is time that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
should go. If your honor will put on this
haori, and, upon entering the gate, demand
Kida&#8217;s ticket, there will be no difficulty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inouye dressed, and the two descended toward
the city. The road passed by one of the
Gosho gates, and the guide entered, exclaiming
his name, whereupon he received a wooden
ticket with his name in large characters, and
passed through. Inouye followed his example,
and received a similar ticket bearing the name
of Kida. The two then walked up a broad
gravel path toward one of the enclosures.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all his self control, Inouye
experienced great difficulty in not betraying his
intense curiosity. He, as every Japanese of
his class, thought with intense reverence of
Tenshi Sama. His heart would have leaped
for joy if he had received orders to die that
moment for the man he had never seen. We
can not understand that feeling. Loyalty is a
meaningless sound compared to it. Yet it was
that feeling which metamorphosed a federacy
of some three hundred autonomous oligarchies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
poverty stricken and at war with one another,
into a powerful empire which bids Russia defiance.
This marvel, too, was accomplished in
less than three decades!</p>

<p>Inouye&#8217;s curiosity was, therefore, blended
with awe. The guide stopped before a house
of modest dimensions, but of light and elegant
construction, and, bowing, preceded his companion.
Stopping on the verandah, he uttered
his name in a low but distinct voice. An answer
was returned, and he beckoned Inouye to
enter. The latter did so, and, prostrating himself,
ejaculated rapidly such phrases of self-depreciation
as the high rank of a Kugé demanded.</p>

<p>Karassu Maru,<a href="#A72">[72]</a> the master of the house,
was a young man of about Inouye&#8217;s age,
dressed in haori, hakama, and kimono all of
fine silk. He scanned Ito&#8217;s features keenly,
and appeared satisfied with the result. He was
evidently of a quick, impulsive temper, but used
the courtly language, and strictly observed his
own dignity.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>&#8220;I am informed that you have a proposition
to place before me on behalf of Mori.<a href="#A73">[73]</a>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am but the messenger, My Lord, and
my authority extends only to requesting an audience
of your lordship for the first councillor
and friend of my Lord Mori.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, you know, there is some danger in
coming to and going from the Gosho. Our
friends of the Aidzu Clan, whom the Go rojiu
has kindly deputed to guard us here, seem to
scent danger, for they have drawn the lines
tighter and tighter. It would be better if I
knew something of what Mori wishes, so that
both time and risk could be saved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you, my lord, what I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inouye then gave a comprehensive but concise
review of Kido&#8217;s intentions, reserving, of
course, the conclusions of his leader, and the
share he intended to assign to the Gosho.
Karassu Maru listened attentively, and when
Inouye concluded, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;When do you expect the councillor of your
clan?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>&#8220;He will come, your Lordship, as soon as I
let him know that he may have an audience.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am willing to hear him, but he will need
great powers of persuasion. Of my personal
friends, one is an idiot, and the other a fool.
No; I can&#8217;t do a thing, although I would like
to try. The affair ought to be begun by one of
the Miya,<a href="#A74">[74]</a> but that is altogether out of the
question. Ni-jo?<a href="#A75">[75]</a> bah! he would not stir.
Sanjo? Yes, he might. Aye, I think that he
would. Hold on! There is Tomomi. He is
the man!&#8221;</p>

<p>This was evidently not destined for the ears
of Inouye, who was listening but without any
expression in his features. Karassu Maru
looked up, and said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;See that Mori&#8217;s councillor is here on the
tenth day from now. The same retainer who
brought you here will call for him, and I shall
arrange a meeting. Now about getting out.
He clapped his hands, and when the attendant
appeared, he said: &#8216;Get the football ready, and
invite Honami and Gojo with their retainers to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
join me in a game. You, sir, come along.
When we come to the wall near the gate the
guard will be watching us. See to it that you
do not kick it over the wall, for I am a good
hand at scolding, and you would not care to be
called clumsy, would you? If, however, you
should send it flying over the wall, run after it,
and throw it back. We shall entertain the
guard.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>It was dark when Inouye returned to the
temple, but he wrote at once to Kano. The letter
was foolish, and made the writer appear to
live only for amusement. It described the magnificence
of the temples and urged Kano to be
present at a festival to take place on the tenth
day. There was nothing in it of the slightest
interest to any spy.</p>

<p>Kano was at home when the letter was delivered
to him. He saw, after a close examination,
that it had been opened, but smiled after
he had read its contents. He knew the spy.
Why had Sawa so earnestly requested him to
admit among his retainers a young friend who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
had some slight trouble in his own clan? Kano
had demurred to keep up appearances, but
finally he had agreed, and he knew that there
was no longer any privacy in his house. It
was immaterial to him. He did not know of
one member of his clan in whom he could trust.
Not that there was any doubt whatever of their
loyalty, but one thoughtless word or action
would upset all his plans. He was glad that he
had two such friends as Ito and Inouye. Sonno-Joï!
Why he had heard that cry in his own
clan, here at the confines of Hondo. There had
been no communication from him, and this was
the first that he received from Inouye. Truly,
there was a chance for Choshiu when the clan
numbered among its members such men. O!
if Ekichi might only grow up to such a standard.</p>

<p>He clapped his hands and ordered the child
to be called. The boy came, knelt at the
threshold, and saluted his father with the reverence
due to him, and the gravity of a man.
Kano bowed in return, and said:&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>&#8220;Come here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy came, bowed, and squatted down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you doing well at school?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ekichi bowed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Read that to me,&#8221; he continued, taking up
a book. The boy began to read in the sing-song
tone necessary to render ideographic writing
intelligible to the reader. His father then
inquired after his progress in athletic exercises,
and finally said: &#8220;Come, we shall go into the
garden!&#8221;</p>

<p>They walked together to an artificial hillock,
found in every Japanese garden of any pretensions,
and ascended to the top. Here, safe from
spies, Kano turned to his son:</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen, Ekichi,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You know the
new attendant who came here some months
ago?&#8221; The child bowed. &#8220;Very well; I want
you to be the shadow of that man. He must not
be anywhere, or you must see him; he may
not say a word, or you must hear what it is.
I am going away for a few weeks, and when I
am back, you must read on this hillock every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
afternoon, until I come up, and then you must
tell me what this man has done, whom he has
seen and what he has said. Can you do that
do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>The little fellow felt overjoyed at this token
of his father&#8217;s confidence, but not a look betrayed
that feeling. He accepted the charge
with a simple bow, and went with his father
back to the house.</p>

<p>Kano dressed, and ordered his chair. When
he entered it, he said briefly: &#8220;To the castle!&#8221;
Alighting at the inner entrance, he distinctly
ejaculated his name; a servant appeared and
bade him enter.</p>

<p>The room was almost the same as his sitting-room
in his own house. There was no furniture,
but a kakemono,<a href="#A76">[76]</a> of priceless value in
Japanese eyes, hung from the wall so that the
light fell upon it. A few bronze pieces, masterworks
of art, stood where they appeared to
demand admiration. In the middle of the room
sat the owner of the estate, an estimable gentleman
of middle age, dressed in magnificent silk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
Kano saluted dutifully and was bidden to approach.
He sat down at the prescribed distance,
and waited for his master to address
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad you called,&#8221; said Mori. &#8220;I
want the garden changed, and my cousin told
me that the council had appropriated too much
money for the fortifications at Shimonoseki.
What fad is this? Those works were constructed
under my grandfather, and could not
be made better. It is more important by far
that the garden be altered. Come here! Do
you not see that if I sit here and look out, that
hillock yonder interrupts the view? It must
be changed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano bowed low and said: &#8220;It shall be done,
my lord. I am going to Kyoto on business for
the clan. Is there anything I can do for
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, certainly. If you can pick up any
fine antiquities, do so. And you must order
new haori for the retainers. They will need
them on our next journey to Yedo.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>Kano promised to attend to these matters,
and took his leave. Closing the sho ji behind
him, he went to a distant part of the palace,
and called an attendant. &#8220;Request Mr. Hattori
to come here,&#8221; he said. Hattori came, and
his friend told him that he was called to Kyoto
on private business, and would be absent for
two or three weeks. He requested him to see
that the garden was altered according to the
wishes of the Lord of the Manor. Hattori
promised to comply. Kano then proceeded to
Sawa&#8217;s yashiki, and told him that he had come
to bid him good-bye, as he was going to Kyoto
under orders from my lord to buy some new
ornaments. He asked for a letter to the commandant
of the castle at Kyoto, a request which
was willingly granted. When Kano left, a
small bag of gold remained on the cushion
which he had occupied.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIV<br />
WITHIN THE PALACE</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">In</span> one of the kuge residences, not far from
the palace occupied by the Tenshi sama,
four men had just exchanged the protracted
salutations prescribed by their rank.
All knew that this very meeting would be considered
as treason if it were known to the authorities
at Yedo, and they felt, intuitively, that
it would exercise a great influence upon their
lives. Yet every face bore but one expression,
that of placid contentment.</p>

<p>Sanjo, as the highest in rank, spoke first:&mdash;&#8220;His
Lordship, Karassu Maru has informed
us that the chief Councillor of Mori desires to
make a communication. It is long since the
chief of a clan desired the intercession of a
kuge.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano bowed:&mdash;&#8220;It is the fault of the Tokugawa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
My Lord. The clans are shut out from
Kyoto. We are not permitted to occupy our
yashiki here, unless we secure the gracious consent
of the men who rule at Yedo. I know
none of the old families, Mori, Shimadzu,<a href="#A77">[77]</a>
who would not willingly enroll himself among
the lowest servants of the Son of Heaven.
If you are robbed of the homage which is your
due, surely we suffer more severely by being
shut out from the sacred presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sanjo bowed, and looked at Iwakura Tomomi,
who said:&mdash;&#8220;You speak well, Sir Knight,
and we do not hold the clans responsible for
their compulsory neglect of His Majesty. But
we shall be glad to hear what it is that Mori of
Nagato desires of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Lordships, the Tokugawa has admitted
barbarians within the realm of the divine
ancestors. They are now upsetting all
our time-honored customs at Kanagawa, and
demand admittance at Hyogo. Your humble
servant has dwelt for six weeks among them.
I desired to study them, because I was anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
to know if their unhallowed presence foreboded
evil to our country. I am convinced that it
does. The five relations<a href="#A78">[78]</a> upon which our social
system rests are disregarded and set at
nought by them. They respect nothing we respect.
They are rude and insolent, and act as
if the country of the gods was theirs by right
of conquest. They defy our laws. Who ever
heard of a merchant talking back to a samurai?
Not only do they do this, but they dare order
them about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen that yourself?&#8221; asked
Sanjo.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have, my Lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what did the Tokugawa Knights
do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They did as they were bidden; they obeyed
the orders of the insolent dogs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was no complaint brought?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who would bring a complaint, and before
whom? The samurai is not accustomed to
seek protection. He protects, and in such a
quarrel, his good sword is both judge and executioner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
But, alas! the Tokugawa samurai
is no longer a knight. He has forgotten the
existence of the word duty, and has substituted
the word pleasure. The country is no longer
safe under the guidance of the Tokugawa. It
must be taken away from them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And given to Mori?&#8221; asked Karassu
Maru.</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be decided later, my lord,&#8221; said
Kano calmly. &#8220;At present it is not a question
of who shall rule with Tenshi Sama&#8217;s consent,
but if the country shall be safe from the invasion
of the barbarians. They may not come in
large numbers for some years; but if they upset
all our sacred customs, they can ruin Japan
without any armed invasion. They are but
few in number now, your lordships, and we
can expel them. But if we wait for a few
years, they will have obtained such a foothold
that we may not be able to succeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But what can we do?&#8221; asked Iwakura.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your lordship, there is but one way. Tenshi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Sama may order the Tokugawa to expel
the barbarians, the order will not be obeyed,
because the clan can not do it, and will not entrust
the work to other clans. But Tenshi
Sama can give an order to all the clans to do it,
and I know of some who will obey His Majesty&#8217;s
orders, regardless of consequences.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Sanjo, &#8220;you know that Tokugawa
is Shogun; all orders must be issued to
him; such is the law and the custom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if Tokugawa can not, or will not
obey?&#8221;</p>

<p>Here was a supposition which was very unpalatable,
and the three kuge were silent. Orders
had been issued from the Palace before,
and had been disregarded, but the kuge had
been respectfully assured that they had been
obeyed. Iwakura knew of one instance, and
the angry blood appeared almost through the
thick coating of self-control and restraint. At
last Karassu Mara said:</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you have us do?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>&#8220;Send peremptory orders to the Go rojiu,
and let the clans know that such orders have
been sent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know, Sir Knight,&#8221; he asked,
&#8220;how we are situated here? Aidzu, one of
the Tokugawa clans that will fight, confound
it! has a guard at every gate. Not a soul goes
in or out, but they know who he is, and I shall
be very much astonished and glad for your
sake, if you return home without some disagreeable
encounter. Why! They discovered
after your messenger had left that a stranger
had been in the palace grounds, and there was
a fine hue and cry. The captain of the guard
came to me and dared ask questions; I don&#8217;t
think he will do it again, for I made him understand
the difference between a kuge and a dog.
We could contrive, perhaps, to send a secret
order. But an open order to the clans! Why,
that messenger must be nimble-footed who
could get as far as one hundred yards from the
gate!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No!&#8221; said Sanjo, &#8220;that suggestion is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
worthless. Mark you, Sir Knight, I do not deny
that the Tokugawa hand has rested heavily
upon the Gosho, but under whatever circumstances,
the Court has maintained its dignity.
Nor would any infringement be permitted. Besides,
while it is true that his Lordship Iwakura
and myself are members of the Inner Council,
we are but two, and the majority is composed
of old men, wedded to the secluded, contemplative
life we lead. If you have no other suggestion
to offer, I am afraid that we can not
help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, my Lord,&#8221; said Kano, &#8220;surely, that
life of seclusion and contemplation ends as soon
as the barbarians land at Hyogo. They are,
even now, clamoring to be admitted into Yedo.
It is only a question of time, perhaps of very
brief time, before they will demand admittance
in Kyoto, and from what I have seen of them,
they will not show any respect for the Sacred
Enclosure.&#8221;</p>

<p>Karassu Maru grasped the hilt of his sword,
while Iwakura and Sanjo were startled.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>&#8220;Ah! That must be prevented at any cost!&#8221;
said the former, and Sanjo bowed assent.</p>

<p>After a few moments Iwakura made a movement
indicating the termination of the audience,
saying: &#8220;Sir Knight, we shall report our
conference to the Council. We do not pretend
to know what the result will be, but I suppose
that, if we wish to communicate with you, his
lordship Karassu Maru will know how to reach
you.&#8221; Deep bows and sucking of the breath
followed, and Kano left escorted by Karassu
Maru, who led the way to a secluded part of
the grounds.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now then, Sir Knight, what do you think
of the prospect? Encouraging, is it not? And
the two gentlemen whom we have left just now,
are the most progressive. Now, let me give
you a hint. The Miya and kuge, I say it with
all respect, have taken root into the ground.
That root must be torn up by main force, before
they will move. Pull the ground from
under them and you will succeed. If you can
not find means to do that, return to your clan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
and prepare to defend yourself. By the way!
Are you acquainted with a gigantic Satsuma
knight, who loves the Tokugawa as much as
you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not, my Lord,&#8221; said Kano, surprised.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he, too, is in hiding in some temple.
Hunt him up, and work together. Two can do
more than one. Now, how are you going to
leave here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw a nosimono going to one of the palaces
a moment ago, is it going beyond the
gate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that is his lordship Honami, who is
so exceedingly bright that he can go wherever
and whenever he pleases, but why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can not your lordship arrange that I shall
be one of the bearers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, certainly. Come this way and wait
in that copse.&#8221; Karassu Maru returned after
half an hour&#8217;s absence, evidently in great glee.
He said that Honami had consented to carry a
package to the temple where Inouye had rooms.
Karassu Maru then handed to Kano a chair-bearer&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
coat, and kerchief to tie around his
head. It took only a minute to change the
clothes, and to make a bundle of haori, hakama,
kimono, and swords. A little later Honami&#8217;s
well-known nosimono passed through the gate
borne by four stalwart men. When it returned
there were only three. One had been lost, and
poor Honami&#8217;s privileges were curtailed, while
the other chairbearers were subjected to a severe
but useless examination.</p>

UNDERGROUND RUMBLING</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> Choshiu Clan was by no means
alone in taking the alarm at the admittance
of foreigners. The Japanese,
as a nation, possess a dual character, which was
typified in their government. Just as the
Gosho at Kyoto presented the highest degree
of refinement attained by the nation, as well as
the amiability, natural kindness, and light-heartedness
of the people, so did the Camp at
Yedo picture the sterner side of their character
inculcated and developed to the utmost in
the samurai. But the samurai shared with
the people the curiosity which is a national
characteristic, and many had visited Yokohama
for the sole purpose of examining and taking
the measure of these strangers. The early history
of that open port, is one of bloodshed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
Numerous are the names of foreigners in the
graveyard upon the bluff, with the inscription:
Murdered. Yet in not one single instance was
the perpetrator brought to justice. Not one of
these murders was for the purpose of robbery;
in every instance the sharp sword had been
used to avenge some real or fancied insult.</p>

<p>Except the missionaries who arrived as soon
as Japan was opened, there were few, very few
foreigners who made any effort to propitiate
this people. Most of them had lived for some
time in China, where they had met a submissive
people. They treated the Japanese in the same
manner, with very unexpected results. The
resentment turned from the foreigners upon
the government which had admitted them, and
the Tokugawa dynasty was doomed.</p>

<p>But of the Genrô, the statesmen of revolutionary
time, no one had any thought of uniting
Japan into an Empire under the direct rule
of Tenshi Sama. They knew of no history
save that of their own country, and that demonstrated
the Son of Heaven as too sacred a person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
to be troubled with mundane affairs. All
desired a strong country under a strong Shogun.
There is not the least doubt that Satsuma,
Choshiu, and Tosa, to whom Japan
chiefly owes its present greatness, worked with
that end in view. Nor does it detract from
their credit that probably each worked with the
ultimate hope to see his own clan take Tokugawa&#8217;s
place. There was not an atom of selfishness
in this. The chief impulses constituting
our motives in life, the acquisition of
wealth and honor or fame, were unintelligible
to the Japanese at that time.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Kano returned to the temple, where he had
left his chair and bearers, for he was stopping
at the Choshiu yashiki, and entered the room
where Inouye was waiting for him. Having
satisfied himself that there were no listeners, he
briefly summed up the result of his interview
with the kuge. &#8220;There will be no opening of
Hyogo,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The Court will move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
heaven and earth, before it concedes that demand.
But Karassu Maru is right. The
ground must be pulled from under them, before
they will abate one jot of their dignity, such
as they understand it. By the way. Go back
to Nagato as soon as you can. The attention
of the spies will be drawn toward this temple,
because one of the bearers of Honami&#8217;s chair
disappeared here. I shall follow you in a few
days.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two devoted samurai reached their own
province in safety, and the affairs of the clan
continued peaceably, except that a considerable
number of young samurai resigned as members
of the clan, and disappeared. It was not
generally known that their names were not
stricken off the rolls, but that the letters of
resignation were held in a safe place, in case of
emergency. Nobody heard from Ito; at least
not directly. Indirectly the cry of Sonno Joï!
growing more and more common, showed that
he was still gathering recruits in the ranks
against the Tokugawa.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>Kano smiled grimly when he received from
Yedo a copy of a letter sent by the Court to the
Daimiyo of Mito. &#8220;The Bakufu&#8221; (Camp or
Yedo Government) it ran &#8220;has shown great
disrespect of public opinion in concluding treaties
without waiting for the opinion of the
Court, and in disgracing princes so closely allied
by blood to the Shogun. Tenshi Sama&#8217;s
rest is disturbed by the spectacle of such misgovernment
when the fierce barbarian is at our
very door. Do you, therefore assist the Bakufu
with your advice, expel the barbarians, content
the mind of the samurai, and restore tranquillity
to his Majesty&#8217;s bosom.&#8221;</p>

<p>The wedge had entered, but time was required
before it could be driven deeper. Kano
had gradually prepared his friend Hattori to
share his hopes and fears, and effective improvements
had been made in the fortifications
on the coast of Nagato. Cannon, not of very
modern make, but decidedly better than the
rusty fire pieces of old, had been purchased at
Nagasaki and smuggled in at Shimonoseki; a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
supply of powder was also procured, and several
companies of young samurai practiced
daily with the guns. Ekichi had attached himself
to Inouye and was rapidly growing into an
expert swordsman.</p>

<p>One evening, in the beginning of April, Kano
was sitting in his room, talking to his son.
The rain doors were up, for it had been
blowing hard all day, and it looked like
rain. Kano began to think that it was time
to retire, when Ekichi told him that there
was a knock at the rain doors. Kano took
up a lantern, and went on the verandah, when
he heard a muffled voice calling him. He
opened a door and asked who was there, when
he recognized the voice of Ito. He gladly invited
him to enter, and reclosing the door, led
the way to his room. After the customary
salutations, seeing that Ito was cold and wet,
he ordered dry garments to be brought, and
then inquired when he had arrived. Ito replied
that he had come straight to Kano&#8217;s yashiki,
and then asked him if he had heard the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
news. He received a negative answer and
said:&mdash;&#8220;Before I tell you what it is, I must
warn you that you have a spy in the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O! I know that, but he is harmless.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; he is harmless now; but he must
have found out something because the Go rojiu
dogs were hot on my trail.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ekichi,&#8221; said Kano, &#8220;watch around the
rooms; and if you see any one trying to listen,
silence him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy bowed and slipped out.</p>

<p>Ito sipped a cup of tea, and, seeing that Kano
expected him to speak, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Ii Naosuke is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that so? When did he die?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was assassinated in Yedo on the 23rd
of last month.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano knocked the ashes out of his pipe, put
it up, and looked for further particulars. Ito
continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was blowing a severe storm in Yedo that
day. There was rain and sleet, and sometimes
it snowed very heavily. The streets within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the moats of the castle are almost always deserted,
but this time they were wholly so on account
of the weather. It appears that there
was some meeting at the castle. At all events
the Daimiyo of Kii and Owari with their respective
retinues were marching across the
bridge into the inner walls, when the retinue
of the Lord Regent also approached. The last
of the Kii samurai had just left the bridge when
the head of Ii&#8217;s retinue reached it. Several
men in rain coats had been loitering; they
flung off their coats and as samurai in full
armor, attacked the regent&#8217;s escort. These
men were taken unawares, and before they
could drop their rain coats a number of them
had been killed and Ii was dragged out of his
nosimono, and decapitated. Several of the assailants
lost their lives, but the leader escaped
with the head. It is said that they were Mito
rônin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano was silent for some time. At last he
said: &#8220;This is a death blow for the Tokugawa,
for Ii Naosuke was the only man, so far as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
know, who could have propped up that falling
house. For that reason I am glad. But I am
sorry too, for Ii was a patriot. I disagreed
with him, but he may have been right when he
said, in defense of the treaty which he had
made: &#8216;Let us have intercourse with foreign
countries, learn their drill and tactics, and let
us make the nation united as one family.&#8217; I
do not think that he could have succeeded,
but&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a stifled cry and a blow. A moment
later a sho ji opened, and Ekichi came in
holding in one hand the bleeding head of the
spy, and in the other his drawn sword. The
boy said simply: &#8220;I have silenced him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano and Ito both looked at the boy. He
stood there, waiting patiently until his father
should address him. Ito, however, took some
paper from his sleeve, and placed it upon the
woodwork of the grooves, motioning Ekichi to
put the head on it. The boy did so, and Kano
told him to come near and tell him what had
happened.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>&#8220;I have watched him several times, as you
told me to, when he was trying to listen, and
once when he was looking over some of your
papers. Every time he made some excuse, but
I did not answer him. A few moments ago, I
passed into that room, and saw his form crouching
before the sho ji. You had ordered me to
silence him, and I did so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano said a few words in praise, and bade
him go to sleep. Ekichi bowed and withdrew.</p>

<p>Kano went out of the room and in a few moments
returned with Fujii. The old man looked
grimly at the head as he took it up. The body
was removed, and the bloodspots cleaned. It
was merely an incident in the life of old Japan.</p>

THE COURT AROUSED</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> death of Ii Naosuke decided Kano
to return to Kyoto with his friends,
Ito and Inouye, as he said grimly &#8220;to
help pull the ground from under the feet of the
Court.&#8221; His acquaintance with Karassu Maru
was of material assistance to him. This kugé
was of a very impulsive temperament, with none
of that self control, characteristic of the samurai.
Generous to a fault, he was implacable
as a foe. While he frightened some of the
more timid kugé by the boldness of his speech,
he attracted others. The Court mustered the
courage to summon the Shogun to Kyoto, to
answer the charge of misgovernment brought
against him by several clans. No Shogun had
deigned doing homage to Tenshi Sama since
1634. The humble reply from the Go rojiu was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
followed by another command, in which it appeared
plainly that Tenshi Sama&#8217;s advisers
would not entertain a thought of his assuming
the government. It said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Since the barbarian vessels commenced to
visit this country, the barbarians have conducted
themselves in an insolent manner, without
any interference on the part of the Yedo
officials. The consequence has been that the
peace of the empire has been disturbed and the
people have been plunged into misery. Tenshi
Sama was profoundly distressed at these things,
and the Go rojiu on that occasion replied that
discord had arisen among the people, and it was
therefore impossible to raise an army for the
expulsion of the barbarians, but that if His
Majesty would graciously give his sister in
marriage to the Shogun that then the court and
camp would be reconciled, the samurai would
exert themselves, and the barbarians would be
swept away. Thereupon His Majesty good-naturedly
granted the request and permitted the
Princess Kazu to go down to Yedo. Contrary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
to all expectations, however, traitorous officials
became more and more intimate with the barbarians
and treated the imperial family as if
they were nobody; in order to steal a day of
tranquillity they forgot the long years of trouble
to follow, and were close upon the point of asking
the barbarians to take them under their
jurisdiction. The nation has become more and
more turbulent. Of late, therefore, the rônin
of the western provinces have assembled in a
body to urge the Tenshi Sama to ride to Hakone,
and, after punishing the traitorous officials,
to drive out the barbarians. The two
clans of Satsuma and Choshiu have pacified
these men and are willing to lend their assistance
to the court and camp in order to drive
out the barbarians. The Shogun must proceed
to Kyoto to take counsel with the nobles of the
court, and must put forth all his strength, must
despatch orders to the clans of the home provinces
and the seven circuits, and, speedily performing
the exploit of expelling the barbarians,
restore tranquillity to the empire. On the one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
hand, he must appease the sacred wrath of
Tenshi Sama&#8217;s divine ancestors, and, on the
other, inaugurate the return of faithful servants
to their allegiance, and of peace and prosperity
to the people, thus giving to the empire the immovable
security of Taisan.&#8221;<a href="#A79">[79]</a> (Ta shan&mdash;Great
Mountain, the Sacred mountain of
China.)</p>

<p>The effect of Kano&#8217;s visit to the Gosho is
plainly visible in this document. Iyemochi, the
Shogun, paid homage to the Tenshi Sama in
April 1863, and the same year released the Daimiyo
from their compulsory residence at Yedo.
At the same time Kano at last secured the long
coveted imperial order to commence the expulsion
of the barbarians, and he returned to Nagato
in high glee.</p>



<p>In the south-western part of the main island
of Japan, known as Hondo, a narrow strait
separates it from the island of Kiusiu. This
strait is named after the city of Shimonoseki,<a href="#A80">[80]</a>
situated on the northern shore, in Nagato. This
shore is composed of bold bluffs, formed of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
solid rock, covered, however, with abundant
verdure owing to ample moisture and the heat
of the sun. These bluffs control the strait
which forms the western entrance to the Inland
Sea, and is used by all vessels plying between
Japan and China as offering a safe and quick
route. It was here that the Choshiu clan had
reconstructed its fortifications, and supplied
them with new cannon. The clan had also
purchased at great expense two sailing vessels
and a steamer and was thus, as the Council
thought, well equipped to expel the handful of
barbarians.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_165f.jpg" alt="THE FRIENDS WERE STANDING IN A GARDEN" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;THE FRIENDS WERE STANDING IN A GARDEN OF A TEAHOUSE.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the beginning of July, 1863, the friends
were standing in the garden of a teahouse,
whose upper story overlooked the entrance to
the strait, when an attendant appeared and informed
them that a barbarian vessel was approaching.
The party went up-stairs and
watched the ship, as, unable to stem the current,
she came to anchor. &#8220;She is going to stay
there all night&#8221; said Kano grimly. &#8220;Well, we
don&#8217;t want any more foreigners nor their vessels,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
and we will give that one yonder a hint
not to come back again.&#8221; He went out around
the batteries and ordered the officers to open
fire as soon as it should be light enough.</p>

<p>There was grim expectation among Choshiu&#8217;s
samurai at the prospect of an early battle.
They had imbibed the dislike of Kano, and the
cry of Sonno Joï had excited them. Still, they
retired to rest as usual, but were up with the
first dawn. The American bark, the <i>Pembroke</i>,
was not expecting any hostilities. When the
tide turned in the morning, the captain gave orders
to hoist the anchor, when he was startled
by firing and a moment later a ball went
through one of his sails. He had the American
flag hoisted, but it produced no effect, except
that more batteries opened upon her. The two
sailing vessels and the steamer appeared to be
preparing to increase her danger, but the sailors
worked with a will, and soon had her under
weigh. The marksmanship of the Choshiu
gunners, however, was very poor, and the <i>Pembroke</i>
escaped.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>It is scarcely credible that Choshiu intended
to destroy an unarmed vessel; it is more likely
that they meant the firing as a warning to keep
away. Kano was satisfied at the effect which
he thought had been produced. On the morning
of the 16th, about ten days after firing upon
the <i>Pembroke</i>, he was called by one of his retainers,
and informed that a steamer was coming
toward the Strait from the Inland Sea.
After dressing himself hastily, he went to one
of the bluffs where he could observe and at the
same time issue orders. He soon perceived
that it was a war vessel, and sent Ekichi down
to the ships at anchor under the bluff to instruct
them to clear for action. He then ordered Ito
and Inouye to take charge of two of the batteries,
and to open fire as soon as possible. The
barbarian ship, however, did not remain in the
channel, but made at once for the bluff, where,
since the guns could not be sufficiently depressed,
she was safe from the batteries. She
immediately engaged Choshiu&#8217;s vessels, and,
although the samurai were anxious to fight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
and to come to close quarters, they could
scarcely inflict any damage upon their opponents,
because they had not been drilled to this
sort of warfare. Kano was furious when he
saw his expensive ships destroyed, and he was
more angry still when Capt. McDougal of the
saucy U. S. Sloop-of-war <i>Wyoming</i> by a few
parting shots destroyed one of the batteries, and
then steamed away, apparently none the worse
for her late encounter. It did not improve his
temper, when the breeze carried the laughter of
some of the barbarian sailors to his ears.</p>

<p>After the <i>Wyoming</i> had steamed away,
Kano sent for his two friends, and together
they discussed the event of that morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is easy to understand,&#8221; he said, &#8220;why
our ships suffered defeat. Our samurai can
scarcely be expected to learn to handle strange
craft in so short a time. What puzzles me is
that we could not sink her with our batteries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; said Ito, &#8220;that was plain enough.
She steamed straight under us and for the vessels.
If we had been able to loosen the rock,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
we might have sunk her by letting it fall, but if
we had depressed our guns, the shot would
have fallen out of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then they are cowards!&#8221; Kano cried,
&#8220;they knew that we could not hit them there,
and so crept under shelter. I don&#8217;t call that
honorable warfare.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that,&#8221; said Inouye smiling. &#8220;It
is fair in war to take every advantage over an
enemy; besides, it was decidedly no coward
who would come with one small vessel and attack
three, while facing the guns of our batteries.
No! We lack the skill. Suppose we
put armor on our peasants and arm them with
our swords, would they be able to fight as well
as we, who are trained from our youth? The
biggest and most powerful peasant, in armor,
would not be a match for Ekichi. It is the
same thing in this case. We have the weapons,
but we do not know how to use them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We fired well enough when she was in the
channel,&#8221; objected Ito.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but you confessed yourself that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
could not depress your guns, while that fellow
raised his cannon high enough to bring the
whole battery about my ears. I don&#8217;t call it
unfair, but it was a very one-sided affair.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XVII<br />
A CONFERENCE</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">A few</span> days after the experience gained
in the conflict, Kano decided to go to
Kyoto. He announced his decision
to the Council, where no opposition was made.
Indeed, several members, Hattori among the
number, declared that they too would go. They
felt that the Clan had thrown down the gauntlet,
and that there must be victory or annihilation.
There had been a steady emigration of
the young samurai, and even Ekichi had besought
his father to let him go. It was decided
that all should be recalled and ordered to report
at Choshiu&#8217;s yashiki at Kyoto.</p>

<p>When Kano, accompanied by his friends,
and escorted by a corps of six hundred well-armed
samurai arrived at the Capital, he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
scarcely credit his senses. The quiet and almost
solemn city had changed apparently into
a garrison town. Everywhere samurai were
met. The crests of Satsuma, Choshiu, Tosa,
Hizen, and Kaga, jostled with those of the Tokugawa,
with the result that brawls and street
fights were common, and peaceable citizens
scarcely dared leave their houses. The shout
of Sonno Joï was heard everywhere and at all
hours. A revolution was imminent.</p>

<p>It was not long after Kano was installed in
his apartments of the yashiki when an attendant
announced a visitor, who declined giving
his name. Receiving directions to admit him,
a samurai in rônin dress, that is without crest
and his face concealed by a cloth entered. After
saluting, the visitor discarded his disguise, and
Kano recognized the features of Karassu Maru.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Mr. Councillor,&#8221; said the Kuge after
they were seated, &#8220;you have indeed heeded my
advice of pulling the ground from under the
court; you have produced chaos, my friend.
What has struck Aidzu, I can not conceive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Our chairs go in and out of the palace gates
and, instead of being stopped and turned back,
we are politely saluted by the guard. There
must be more of this, and I believe Tenshi Sama
will order the Ph&oelig;nix Car, and promenade in
the city. But how do you propose to restore
order out of this chaos?&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano did not confide enough in his visitor to
disclose his plans. He replied: &#8220;Before building
a new house, my lord, it is best to clear
away the debris, especially after a conflagration.
But, as your lordship knows, I have been
at Nagato for some time, and am very anxious
to know what has happened. I shall feel much
relieved if you will inform me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not know how it came to pass, but
after Iyemochi&#8217;s visit it was easier for the palace
attendants to secure passports, and finally
they were no longer demanded. Sanjo, Iwakura,
and myself, went in and out as we pleased,
and I met a great many rônin, all good fellows.
Sometimes we had a little bout, and swords
were drawn. Taken altogether, there is a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
pleasant change in our condition, and I only
hope it will last.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano saw that Karassu Maru would not help
him much in his scheme. When his visitor
departed, he called Inouye:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you still the haori which Karassu
Maru lent you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have, my lord.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well; I have mine. Let us see if
they will carry us past the gates of the Gosho.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two gentlemen went out. Although
they met numerous parties of boisterous samurai,
they were not molested, since the crest
they wore was known as that of a kuge. When
they came to the gate, Kano walked boldly in,
followed by Inouye.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your tablets, please, gentlemen,&#8221; said one
of the guards, bowing.</p>

<p>&#8220;How now, fellow,&#8221; cried Kano haughtily,
&#8220;who has dared instruct you to address gentlemen
of our quality? Take his name,&#8221; he said
to Inouye, but the man disappeared, and they
passed in.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>Kano remembered the way, and, arriving at
the house where they had met before, he inquired
for Sanjo. He found, however, that
this was the residence of Iwakura, and requested
to be announced. After waiting a few
moments, he found himself in the presence of
the man who was one of the chief instruments
in the re-organization of the empire.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to see you, Mr. Councillor,&#8221; said
the kuge, &#8220;and you come at an opportune time.
Some of us who are interested in the present
movement, were going to meet later on. But
I will request them to come as soon as possible.&#8221;
He clapped his hands, and gave some directions
to the kneeling attendant. Presently a handsome
screen was brought in and placed behind
Kano; then he heard the opening of the sho ji
behind the screen, and surmised that the meeting
would be attended by a person of so exalted
a rank as to be invisible to him.</p>

<p>Iwakura entertained his visitors in that
charming manner, peculiar to the highbred
Japanese. It appeared only a few minutes to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
Kano, when norimono began to arrive, and he
and his friend were presented to the possessors
of names, familiar to every Japanese, high or
low. Ichijo, Nijo, Higashi Kuze,<a href="#A81">[81]</a> all historic
names, appeared. At last a norimono arrived,
and Iwakura himself hastened to receive
this visitor, who, with his attendants was ushered
into the room behind. The other kuge
kept up their conversation, but Kano noticed
from the terms of self-debasement, and the frequent
drawing of the breath, that the last caller
must be, indeed, near to the throne. At last
Iwakura reappeared, and took his seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;My lords,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we have the unexpected
but very gratifying pleasure of having
as visitor the man who really started the movement
which led to such surprising results. Mr.
Kano is the trusted Councillor of our friend
Mori of Nagato, and this gentleman, Mr.
Inouye, he tells me, is his right hand. He has
also informed me, while waiting for your lordships
to arrive, that he has a thousand brave
and devoted samurai at hand, ready to do His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
Majesty&#8217;s bidding, and declares himself ready
to answer any question it may please your
lordships to ask.&#8221;</p>

<p>Five minutes passed in performing the prostrations
incident to this introduction, and Nijo,
as the oldest of the kuge present, spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand quite, Mr. Councillor,
why the peace of the Gosho should be interrupted.
His Lordship Iwakura tells us that
you are the cause, and I doubt not that you have
good reasons. At the same time, I protest that
all these proceedings are highly improper, and
that there is no precedent for them. I am told
that the barbarians are at our door. Well, so
they were six hundred years ago;<a href="#A82">[82]</a> but His
Majesty, as in duty bound, visited the shrine
at Isé,<a href="#A83">[83]</a> and implored the aid of the divine ancestors.
The result is well-known. But the
Gosho was not disturbed. To guard his country
properly, His Majesty needs repose and
contemplation. We like it not, Mr. Councillor,
that his sacred presence should be disturbed.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano and Inouye bowed low, and were silent.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
After some moments of decorous silence, the
kuge next in years spoke:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I agree with my lord Nijo. Why does not
the Shogun expel the barbarians, as is his duty?
The Court has ordered him to do so, and he has
replied that he will do it as soon as the necessary
preparations are made. So that matter is
settled, it seems to me. I do not see what
Mori, Shimadzu, and other captains have to do
with it. His Majesty issues his commands to
the Shogun who executes them reverently.
These proceedings are highly improper, as my
Lord Nijo said. If Mori desires any favor
from the Fount of All Honor, let him apply to
Iyemochi, and when his request, properly endorsed,
reaches us through the proper channel,
it will be considered and answered in due time.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was now Sanjo&#8217;s turn. &#8220;I have listened,
my lords, with profound satisfaction to the lessons
drawn from the ripe experience of my
seniors. But I submit that our visitors be
heard, since, having the misfortune to be mere
soldiers, they may not be able to appreciate to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
the full extent the wisdom concentrated within
the Council of Kuge.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this appeal to their forbearance, the kuge
bowed, and Kano, seizing his fan, began in a
low but distinct voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel deeply, my lords, my own unworthiness,
and appreciate the honor of being admitted
to this august assembly.&#8221; Here he prostrated
himself, and remained fully three minutes,
his head resting upon his outstretched
hands. He then recovered his position, and
continued:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Only a few years ago the country of the
gods was at peace, thanks to Tenshi Sama and
his intercession with the divine ancestors, and
the repose of the Son of Heaven was undisturbed.
Suddenly black ships appeared near
the capital of the Tokugawa, and, being ordered
to withdraw, refused to obey this reasonable
behest. What did Tokugawa do?
Smite the disobedient barbarians and hurl them
back to their own desolate country? No!
<i>Tokugawa was afraid.</i> The strangers departed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
but returned with reinforcements the next year.
There had been ample time to call upon the
clans to prepare for their visit, but <i>Tokugawa
was afraid</i>. The Go rojiu pretended to be unprepared,
and conceded all that the barbarians
saw fit to ask. It was not much, but it was
only the beginning of their demands. Four
years later they asked more. They wanted
land and the Tokugawa sold what was not
his to sell. It was only a few tsubo,<a href="#A84">[84]</a> in a
poor fishing village, but it was soil of the country
of the gods, part of the inheritance of the
Son of Heaven. What did the divine ancestors
say about this alienation of their sacred
soil? My lords, you lay the blame of the disturbance
of the sacred bosom upon me. I and
my clan are ready to expiate our sin, if by doing
so we can restore peace to the Light of our Day,
to Tenshi Sama. But that peace can be restored
only by placating His Majesty&#8217;s ancestors,
when they receive back their own.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unconsciously, for Kano was not acting but
meant every word he said, he stopped and allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
time for his words to sink into their
breasts. No one lost his decorum, still, a movement
of the fan, or a readjustment of the haori,
betrayed the uneasiness of the kuge.</p>

<p>Kano resumed suddenly, with a slightly elevated
voice:</p>

<p>&#8220;Aye, the divine ancestors must be placated,
peace must be restored within the sacred walls
of the Gosho, but the barbarians must be expelled
before it can be accomplished. Hark
ye! my lords. Myriads of samurai have come
to this capital, and there is but one shout:
Sonno-Joï! Revere the Emperor! Expel the
foreigners! The breeze from the ocean gently
fans our cheeks, so long as the gods look placidly
down, while we, their humble servants,
pay them our dues in respectful homage. But
sometimes we fail in our duty. The breeze
turns into a wind, the wind into a tai-fu,<a href="#A85">[85]</a> and
it sweeps all before it, the hovel of the laborer
and the roof of the temple. What mortal can
bid it refrain? The Yamato Damashii is the
lovable zephyr of our country, but the presence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
of these insolent barbarians has converted it
into a mighty wind. Hark ye, my lords, do
you hear it swell? Sonno Joï! It is turning
into a tai-fu now!&#8221;</p>

<p>Assuming the plaintive and appealing voice
to which the language lends itself so well, Kano
continued as if in self-commune:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;We heed it not. The storm centres in our
beloved land where the sun rises, but there is
no rift in the clouded sky. The sun smiles
upon the myriads of ships, cleaving the blue
waters, and hurrying to the shores of our land.
It is one long procession. Their spies have
told the barbarians in their inhospitable regions
of the one country where the gods love to dwell.
From tens of rude, insolent men, they have increased
to hundreds; they are now thousands
and will soon be myriads. Tokugawa is no
longer a vassal of Tenshi Sama, he is a servant
to men scarce better than brutes. Hyogo and
Osaka, are in their possession. The two roads
to the sacred capital are crowded with them.
Ye gods! will ye not at least preserve the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Gosho and your child? They press against the
wall, it gives way. Where is the peace and
contemplation of the sacred enclosure now!&#8221;</p>

<p>His sighing voice melted into the silence,
when in a strident tone that made them start, he
concluded:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! Sonno Joï roars out of a myriad
throats. Myriads of brawny hands clasp the
swords of Japan. Tenshi Sama has spoken
through his brave miya and kuge. Clan after
clan marches on, sun of victory for Yamato
Damashii has come forth from behind the
clouds and inspired Dai Nippon&#8217;s sons. The
Tokugawa has paid the penalty of treason; the
barbarians have fled before the edge of the
Soul of Samurai. Peace is restored and flowers
innumerable and of brilliant colors delight
the eye. After the tempest calm. Not that
treacherous, oppressive air, forerunner of disaster.
But the bright atmosphere which succeeds
the storm as surely as prosperous peace
will follow the tempest raging now, and which
is the punishment for our neglect of duty.&#8221;</p>

FLIGHT</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Solemn</span> was the scene, after Kano had
concluded his address. He himself was
prostrate once more, and remained in
that position for more than five minutes, while
not even the rustling of a silk hakama disturbed
the silence. They sat like men of wax, immovable
and serene. There was a rustling of
silk behind the screen, it was removed, and a
gentleman on whose haori appeared the imperial
crest entered. All prostrated themselves,
and he answered with a dignified bow. One of
his attendants brought a cushion, and when he
had squatted down, he said:</p>

<p>&#8220;Rise, Mr. Councillor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano and Inouye obeyed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have heard your statement and we approve
of Mori&#8217;s loyalty as expressed by you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
Your report will receive our early attention and
will be submitted to the proper authority. Fear
not, son of Nagato, Tenshi Sama and our ancestors
are keeping guard. Now go! You
will receive our orders. Tomomi,<a href="#A86">[86]</a> see to it
that these gentlemen are refreshed.&#8221; He bowed
slightly and left the room. The other kuge
followed as if they were glad to get away, and
only Sanjo and Iwakura remained.</p>

<p>The latter ordered refreshments, and when
they were brought, said: &#8220;Mr. Kano, I, and I
suppose my lord Sanjo, are highly pleased. We
have been in the minority, and have been in
grave danger of our lives. But you have converted
the miya nearest to the throne, and
whatever happens, he is beyond danger, and a
most powerful ally. Still, our council is large;
and if Tokugawa replaces the present commandant
by one who will make his authority
felt, we shall be just where we were before.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My lords, may I speak freely? I do not
ask safety for myself. My life is worthless,
but my cause and my clan are dear to me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
Promise me that if I exceed the limits of propriety,
or if what I say appears to you as high
treason, you will permit me to let me expiate
my transgression alone, and that it shall never
go beyond these walls. My young friend will
share my doom, so that the secret will remain
locked up between you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both Iwakura and Sanjo bowed assent.</p>

<p>Kano after thanking them, said:&mdash;&#8220;Imperial
orders are issued over His Majesty&#8217;s sign manual,
and the tenor of those orders depends naturally
upon the sympathy of the kuge in charge.
Could not a change be effected by which it was
placed within the hands of one favorable to the
cause of Japan?&#8221;</p>

<p>Iwakura looked at Sanjo and shook his head.
&#8220;Impossible,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The sign manual is
held for life by one appointed by Tenshi Sama
upon the request of a majority of the council.
No,&#8221; he repeated, &#8220;that can not be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In that case,&#8221; suggested Inouye, speaking
before Kano could commit himself, &#8220;can not his
Majesty be induced to ride to Hakone and drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
the foreigners into the ocean. This would call
forth such a host as Dai Nippon has never seen.
There would be no danger, no risk even, for I
am sure that the barbarians would not await the
approach of such an army. They would take
ship and depart, with the conviction that Dai
Nippon was opposed to their presence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That might be done,&#8221; said Sanjo, approvingly.
&#8220;Send me an official letter signed with
the seal of your clan and containing that request,
and I shall submit it to the Council. But
do it at once, and while the impression made by
Mr. Kano is vivid. Let there be no delay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If your lordships will order one of your
servants to go with us, the letter shall be written
at once,&#8221; replied Kano, preparing to depart.
As they were leaving, a gentleman approached
followed by a page. &#8220;Are these the gentlemen
from Nagato?&#8221; he inquired. Being assured
of their identity, he took a long package from
the page and severing a cord, presented one to
Kano and one to Inouye. &#8220;His Imperial Highness
Prince Arisugawa bids you accept these as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
a token of his good will,&#8221; he said. Both prostrated
themselves and lifted the present to their
forehead. When they arrived home, they found
each a costly sword.</p>

<p>The letter was written and submitted to the
Council. Kano&#8217;s address must have made a
deep impression, for he was informed in a private
communication from Sanjo that his suggestion
had been adopted, and orders had been
issued to make the necessary preparations. At
this time the fate of the foreigners in Japan
hung by a thread.</p>

<p>Of all the clans of the Tokugawa family,&mdash;Iyeyasu
had endowed his sons with ample estates,&mdash;all
but Aidzu seemed as if stricken with
palsy at the storm raging about them. But
Aidzu, in its mountain home, had preserved its
manhood, and despatched to Kyoto a man of
penetration and dauntless courage. Shortly
after taking command, the guards at the palace
gates were quadrupled, and all ingress and
egress prohibited, except under a most severe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
system of passports, obtained from the commandant
himself.</p>

<p>On the 30th of September, 1863, Kano was
sitting in his room overlooking the accounts of
the clan, when Ito and Inouye entered hurriedly.
There was no diminution of the salutations,
and both waited until the Councillor
spoke. Kano, however, saw at once that something
important had occurred, and he simply requested
them to speak.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your lordship,&#8221; said Ito, &#8220;there is something
in the air. The commandant of the castle
has issued orders to the people to close their
houses and keep within, on penalty of being cut
down. Armed patrols are in every street, and
strong bodies of Aidzu men have taken up positions
near the palace.&#8221; At this moment an officer
of the guard at the gate entered, and beckoned
to Kano, who rose angrily and demanded
if he had forgotten his manners. His explanation,
however, seemed to satisfy the Councillor,
for he said: All right, and hurried out. Presently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
he returned accompanied by seven gentlemen,
among whom Ito and Inouye recognized
Sanjo and Iwakura.</p>

<p>Rigidly observant of the salutations the company
was at last seated, when Karassu Maru
remarked:</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Councillor, I hope Mori&#8217;s larder is well
supplied, for I am afraid you are going to have
us as your guests for some time.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano bowed and calling a servant ordered
dinner to be prepared, when Sanjo spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;My lord Karassu Maru chooses an odd
time for pleasantry, but I am afraid, Mr. Councillor,
that there is more truth in what he says
than can be agreeable to you or us. The Council
has honored myself and the gentlemen with
me, with a decree of banishment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Perturbed as he was, Kano bowed, and said
simply:&mdash;I hope that it may please your lordships
to accept the hospitality of Mori such as
it is, but which is freely offered. Permit me to
look after the safety of your lordships.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>He went to the quarters of the commandant.
&#8220;Have all the men under arms, and prepare to
defend the gates. See that no man bearing the
Tokugawa crest enters upon your life. Admit
all stragglers, but no one is permitted to leave
the yashiki except on written order over my
seal. See that the arms and equipments are in
proper order, for at five o&#8217;clock we march. Any
disobedience will be punished most severely. Is
this understood?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. Send for Mr. Hattori.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is in my room now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kano entered. &#8220;Hattori,&#8221; he said, &#8220;we
have received a severe check, but there is
no time to explain. Ride for your life to Nagato,
and inform Mori that seven kuge have
been banished, and will accept his hospitality.
Do not let him entertain the idea of changes in
the rooms of the palace, but tell him that we
shall be there almost as soon as you. As you
pass by, engage rooms in the usual temples.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>Hattori at once ordered a horse. Satisfied
that there would be no delay, Kano sent for
Ekichi:</p>

<p>&#8220;Dress as a boy of the common people,&#8221; he
said. &#8220;In a few minutes Mr. Fujii will give
you a basket of eggs, and tell you their price.
Then go slowly to the castle; notice closely
everything you see, and report to me. Try to
sell your eggs to the soldiers of the guard, but
be careful that they do not suspect you. Be
back by about four.&#8221;</p>

<p>The boy was ready in a few minutes, and the
Councillor himself saw him through the gate
and gave him the pass word. He then returned
to his guests, and informed them that they
would leave for Choshiu at five.</p>

<p>While they were eating their dinner, Karassu
Maru entertained the company, this was
the time for relaxation, and his remarks elicited
not unfrequently peals of laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think that Honami is to blame for the
whole thing. He came to me this morning,
and said:&mdash;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>&#8220;&#8216;What do you think? I am going to buy
some rabbits.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;It did not interest me very much, but for
the sake of politeness, I asked: &#8216;where?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Oh!&#8217; he said, &#8216;I have seen some beauties
in Karassu Maru cho.&#8217;<a href="#A87">[87]</a></p>

<p>&#8220;I thought that he was indulging in personalities,
and said:</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You don&#8217;t take me for a rabbit-warren do
you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;You? No; I wish you were.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Shouts of laughter greeted this sally, and the
speaker laughed as heartily as the others.
&#8220;Well,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;I grew tired of his
interesting conversation, and remarked that the
rabbits might be waiting for him. This suggestion
seemed to strike him, for away he
trotted.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was not gone long before he came back
in a great temper, and begged me to go with
him to the gate, because they would not let him
pass. He had told the guard, he said, that he
had a very important appointment, but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
would not listen to reason.&#8221; There was a dangerous
glitter in Karassu Maru&#8217;s eye, as he
continued: &#8220;I thought that the guard might
have taken liberties with a kuge, and was going
to give him a lesson in politeness. But
when we came to the gate, an officer stepped out
and said: &#8216;Pardon me, my lord, but I am under
orders to let no one pass. The Council is in
session and your lordship will soon know the
reason. I am compelled to escort you to your
house.&#8217; The fellow was serious enough, and
under guard of a dozen men I returned, Honami
in his chair asking constantly about his
rabbits. I had no stomach for them then.&#8221;</p>

BATTLE AND DEFEAT</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">It</span> was a sullen procession which filed out of
Choshiu&#8217;s yashiki on that 30th of September,
and it was well for the Tokugawa
that no armed opposition was offered to them.
Twelve hundred deeply insulted samurai could
make sad havoc among any force, and these
men hoped for the fray. They had marched
in close ranks with seven norimono, well
guarded between them. Kano was on horseback
and had assumed command. He, too, had
thought of the possibility of a conflict; but
Ekichi had discovered that Satsuma had also
been expelled, and that Choshiu would have to
face the united power of Tokugawa. Loyalty
to his clan, and the responsibility for the safety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
of the kuge imposed self-restraint; but they
did not prevent him from being exasperated.</p>

<p>Past Fushimi<a href="#A88">[88]</a> they marched, and on to
Osaka where they remained over night. The
next morning they stopped at Hyogo; it was
eight days after they had left Kyoto when they
were within their own province, and shortly
after Mori in his state dress received the highly
honored guests, and bade them make themselves
at home.</p>

<p>Kano heard that Sawa had disappeared.
That was well. Choshiu&#8217;s samurai might not
have liked to see the Tokugawa crest among
them, and the blood of such a poor worthless
creature, could not further the cause. But
Choshiu thirsted for vengeance, and drilling
went on from morning till night. Nagato was
an armed camp.</p>

<p>Thus passed the winter and spring of the
year 1864. Kano heard that the number of
rônin multiplied at a frightful rate, and that
many were congregating in the suburbs of
Kyoto. Several young samurai applied for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
leave of absence, and, when they received a refusal,
sent in their resignations and disappeared.</p>

<p>The men were exasperated. On the 4th of
August a courier from Kyoto brought news
which caused Kano to call an extra meeting of
the Council. When they had come together,
Kano informed them that in the beginning of
July a body of rônin had petitioned Tenshi
Sama to remove the decree of arrest from Mori,
and to recall the seven kuge and restore them
to honor; but the Council of the Gosho, now
wholly under the influence of Aidzu had not
even vouchsafed a reply. Several hundred
Choshiu men had joined the rônin, and were
preparing to march upon Aidzu.</p>

<p>This was serious news. What if Aidzu, in
triumph at its success, should secure a decree of
<i>Choteki</i><a href="#A89">[89]</a> against Mori from the servile court.
That must be prevented at any cost! Kano
and Hattori were commissioned to proceed in
all haste to Kyoto, and to restrain their clansmen.
They arrived at the capital on the 15th,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
and, appealing to the loyalty of their men, succeeded
in bringing them back under Choshiu&#8217;s
banner.</p>

<p>Aidzu did not appreciate this self-control.
On the 19th a Court messenger delivered a
notification at the yashiki that Mori was to be
punished for contumacy, and that Tokugawa
Keiki<a href="#A90">[90]</a> would command the loyal army commissioned
to enforce the Court&#8217;s order.</p>

<p>Kano and Hattori deliberated long and earnestly.
There was not much choice. It was
either to submit to punishment, which would
strike their innocent lord the hardest of all, or
trust to the spirit of unrest and leave the decision
to the sword. The latter alternative was
chosen, and Kano prepared a proclamation. He
demonstrated the justice of his cause and mentioned
the crimes committed by the Tokugawa
since the arrival of Perry; he called upon the
samurai of Japan to aid him in punishing
Aidzu, who was desecrating the private grounds
of Tenshi Sama, and implored the pardon of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
the Son of Heaven &#8220;for creating a disturbance
so near the wheels of the Chariot.&#8221;</p>

<p>The number of Choshiu men had increased
to 1300. Kano had divided his men in three
divisions, and, at dawn of the 20th of August,
marched to the attack. His intention was to
surround the flower garden of the palace where
Aidzu&#8217;s troops were encamped. They were
opposed by the samurai of Aidzu who had been
reenforced by those of Echizen, Kuwana, Hikone,
and other Tokugawa clans. There were
some cannon and muskets; but most of the
men were in armor, and trusted to the keen
native sword. With terrible odds against
them, and no clan coming to their assistance,
Choshiu maintained the fight for two days. A
native historian states that 811 streets, 18 palaces,
44 large yashiki, 630 small yashiki, 112
Buddhist temples, and 27,000 houses were destroyed.
The same historian says: &#8220;The city,
surrounded by a ninefold circle of flowers, entirely
disappeared in one morning in the smoke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
of the flames of a war fire. The Blossom Capital
became a scorched desert.&#8221; The end was
such as might have been expected. The Choshiu
men were utterly defeated. Thirty-seven
men were taken prisoner and beheaded in
prison. Kano died in battle, and his body was
probably cremated, for it was not found.</p>

<p>When the fugitives began to arrive in Nagato,
there was almost a panic among the
samurai. Ito and Inouye, now recognized as
leaders, restored quiet. It was not the defeat
which had the effect of frightening men for
whom pain nor death has any terror: it was
the term <i>choteki</i>, which rendered their arm
nerveless. It was only when Inouye proved to
them that it was Aidzu and not Tenshi Sama
who had inflicted this disgrace upon them that
their courage returned together with their self-control.</p>

<p>The clan would soon stand in need of it. By
Kano&#8217;s order they had continued to fire upon
vessels entering the Strait of Shimonoseki.
They had Tenshi Sama&#8217;s mandate to do so, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
it had not been revoked. On the 5th of September
a fleet of powerful vessels appeared, and
bombarded Choshiu&#8217;s forts. The men stood to
their guns like heroes, but again the odds were
against them. The batteries were blown about
their ears, and when landing parties attacked
the forts, individual daring backed by swords,
could not stand before the withering fire of
trained troops. The clan despatched Ito and
Inouye to make peace, and the terms hard as
they were, were accepted.</p>

<p>It was two days after the bombardment, and
a meeting of the Council had been called in the
great hall of the castle. Ito and Inouye, both
Councillors now, were present. After all were
seated, Ito opened the meeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gentlemen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;there is little use in
mourning for losses, since it will not repair
them. But losses may be turned into an advantage,
if we profit by the lessons we may derive
from them.</p>

<p>&#8220;The foreign fleet which attacked us had
such heavy metal, that our guns and gunners<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
could not stand before it. It was a hail storm
of iron and we went down before the blast.
But when I saw that the barbarians were landing
men, I thought that we were going to have
our turn. They were but a handful, those barbarians,
and man for man, our samurai would
have made short work of them. But we could
not get near them. They moved as one man
and in the thickest of the fight a word of command
was obeyed as if it was a machine instead
of a body of men. It was their discipline and
drill that defeated us, gentlemen, and we must
acquire that same order and skill.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have met two foes, and twice we have
been defeated. The barbarians will not molest
us so long as we do not molest them, and, for
the present at least, we shall leave that to other
clans who may wish to pay for some experience.
We stand face to face with another foe,
and we are fighting for our very existence.
Tokugawa would have us Choteki, gentlemen,
and we must turn the tables upon them. We
can do it, never fear! But first we must learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
the drill and tactics from the barbarians that
we may give Aidzu a surprise as the foreigners
surprised us. For that purpose we must engage
instructors and purchase arms. I now
propose that Mr. Inouye be appointed with full
authority to act in this matter, and that the
treasurer of the clan furnish him with money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; objected one of the older members,
&#8220;the barbarian instructors will have to live
among us; will they be safe? We do not want
any more trouble with them now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your lordship speaks well. We do not
want any more trouble with them <i>now</i>. The
next time we have trouble with them, it will not
be we who pay the bills. They will be as safe
here as in their own homes. Our samurai shall
know why they are here. They shall know
that we must dissemble; pretend that we are
pleased with our defeat, and that we love the
men who invaded our soil. But this dissembling
will not last forever, and a time shall come
when this defeat is wiped out. May we live to
see it!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>The order was then passed and Ito resumed:
&#8220;The next thing that <i>must</i> be done is to come
to an understanding with Satsuma and the
other Southern clans. Yes, I know, gentlemen,
the dish is not palatable, but there is nothing
for it but to eat it.&#8221; A feud existed
between Satsuma and Choshiu and to the
older Councillors this advice was extremely repugnant.
&#8220;We have no choice. Choshiu
alone can not reduce the united Tokugawa
Clans, and Tokugawa must be deposed unless
we wish to see the barbarian our master.
Satsuma, after all, is of our blood, and has the
same interests. Tosa too, must join. I propose
then that I undertake this disagreeable
work; somebody must do it, and I do not suppose
that any one cares for the honor.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a silence. At last one of the
Councillors spoke: I suppose that Mr. Ito is
right. Let it be as he wishes. I agree with
him that of the two, Satsuma is preferable to
the barbarians.</p>

<p>The order was entered upon the books and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
the council adjourned. The two friends left
together. Inouye said he would start the next
day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any objection if I take Ekichi
with me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Ito looked up, smiled, and said: &#8220;None at
all.&#8221;</p>

DRILLING</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">The</span> severe defeats suffered by Choshiu
had reduced the number of samurai
of the clan. After thinking deeply
upon the matter, Ito proposed to the Council a
measure which met with the most strenuous
opposition, and, being earnestly supported by
Inouye, was at last adopted with many an
ominous shake of the head. It was, namely,
that the ranks should be recruited from among
the young and strong members of the people.
The older members of the council urged, not
unnaturally, that the samurai would never suffer
such an infringement upon the privileges
of their rank. Both Ito and Inouye had more
confidence in the loyalty of the samurai, and
they were right. The very best of foreign
rifles had been purchased by Inouye and arrived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
in due time. Then the instructors came,
and drilling went on from morning to night.
The young men of the people vied with the
samurai in zeal and enthusiasm, they were all
equally and regularly paid and well treated.
After some time artillery began to arrive, and
a corps of men was detailed to learn gunnery.
Among all the young men there was none more
zealous than Ekichi. After a year&#8217;s drill, when
officers were appointed he was made a lieutenant.</p>

<p>In the shadow side of the dual part in the
Japanese character, there is no passion so strong
as that of revenge. Subterfuge, the most dastardly
treachery, are praiseworthy and commendable,
if they serve to obtain revenge for
the killing of a near relation. The written
constitution of old Japan (Legacy of Iyeyasu),
prescribed:</p>

<p>&#8220;In respect to revenging injury done to master
or father, it is granted by the wise and virtuous
(sage)<a href="#A91">[91]</a> that you and the injurer can
not live together under the canopy of heaven.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>&#8220;A person harboring such vengeance shall
notify the same in writing to the Criminal
Court; and although no check or hindrance
may be offered to his carrying out his desire
within the period allowed for that purpose, it is
forbidden that the chastisement of an enemy
be attended with riot.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fellows who neglect to give notice of their
intended revenge are like wolves of pretext, and
their punishment or pardon should depend upon
the circumstances of the case.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ekichi suspected Sawa. If he had been
asked for the reason, he would have been at a
loss, except that he had seen him at Kyoto on
the day of the flight of the kugé. He had
never liked the spy, and he had worshiped his
father. The lesson of self-control, thoroughly
mastered by him, enabled him to bend his mind
upon his studies. But the moments which he
allowed himself for relaxation, were spent in
brooding upon revenge.</p>

<p>Inouye suspected it, and for that reason had
taken him with him to Yokohama. While there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
he had found time to go to Kanagawa where
he called upon the physician in his samurai
dress. The family scarcely recognized their
former houseboy who, in gratitude for former
kindness, presented his late employer with a
choice piece of lacquer. Inouye had watched
Ekichi keenly during this visit, and had noticed
the absolute self control with which he received
the advances of the barbarians. At dinner, he
simply imitated Inouye but with such perfect
self-possession, that it seemed as if he had been
using knife and fork all his life, although it was
the first time he saw them.</p>

<p>At Yokohama, too, his face expressed no
emotion at what he saw; only when in passing
the hatoba, Inouye remarked that his father
had worked here, the boy prostrated himself
and saluted. He was utterly unconscious of
the laughter of some rude barbarians. Inouye
noticed, however, that he asked for the names
in English, after he had heard him converse in
that language.</p>

<p>When they returned to Nagato, he had asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
to be enrolled in the army and his request was
granted. Inouye had offered to teach him English,
an offer which was gladly accepted, and
he made such progress that he was able to read
understandingly and to keep up a fair conversation.</p>

<p>The Tokugawa in the meanwhile was boasting
of how the Shogun would annihilate Choshiu,
and in 1865 Iyemochi himself took the
field. The foreigners at Yokohama were permitted
to witness the march of the redoubted
troops. They came straggling by, as an eye-witness
describes in bands of three or four, a motley
array, with very little stomach for the business
in hand. The same witness states that, upon arrival
at Odawara<a href="#A92">[92]</a> the majority of the higher
samurai applied for leave of absence on account
of sickness; whereupon they were told that
they could go, but that their revenues would be
taken from them, whereupon they recovered
their health. They remained that year quartered
at Kyoto and Osaka, for the Shogun did
not care to lead such an army against a brave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
and desperate clan. He tried to induce other
clans to join him, but they refused flatly.</p>

<p>Stung by the ridicule heaped upon them by
Japanese and foreigner alike, the Tokugawa
troops at last opened the campaign, in the summer
of 1866. Instead of attempting to overwhelm
the clan by sheer force of numbers, Iyemochi
divided his army into three divisions,
each of which was separately routed by Choshiu.
This restored the prestige of the clan,
while it ruined that of Tokugawa.</p>

<p>In every battle Ekichi had excelled for coolness
and courage, and it was predicted that he
would rise as his father had done before him.
In the latter part of September the news was
brought to Nagato that Iyemochi, the Shogun
was dead. Shortly later it also became known
that Tokugawa Keiki had succeeded, but by
appointment from Tenshi Sama.</p>

<p>The death of Tenshi Sama Osahito,<a href="#A93">[93]</a> better
known by his posthumous name of Komei<a href="#A94">[94]</a>
Tenno, and the succession of his son Mutsuhito,
then a boy of fifteen produced a great change.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Ito and Inouye held frequent and long conferences,
and the former was often absent from the
clan.</p>

<p>Their own experience within Choshiu&#8217;s narrow
limits, had convinced them that they were
on the right track. The whole strength of Choshiu&#8217;s
clan had been called out, and had repeatedly
defeated the overwhelming forces of the
Tokugawa; but it had been able to do so only
after acquiring the principles of foreign art of
war. Ito disliked and mistrusted the foreigners,
whereas Inouye&#8217;s experience as well as
his strong power of discernment rather inclined
him toward them. Both, however, were agreed
in their love of their country; and both agreed
that the Japanese must acquire every particle of
knowledge in the possession of the barbarians.
More than that: their manners, habits, and customs,
must be studied and such as served in any
way to strengthen the national life, must be
introduced and adapted. But before anything
could be done in that direction, the Tokugawa
must be laid low. Nothing could possibly be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
done so long as a clan so degenerate was foremost
in the country.</p>

<p>Ito went to Satzuma, and met OKubo, Saigo,
and Terashima. In OKubo and Terashima he
met men who felt and thought like he. Saigo,
a splendid specimen of manhood, over six feet
in height, was equally predisposed against the
Tokugawa, but was not able to look beyond the
clan. As there was no warrant against any of
these men except those of the Choshiu clan,
they moved to Kyoto, and the rebuilt capital
again became a hotbed of intrigue.</p>

<p>Tokugawa Keiki declined the appointment of
Shogun, but was compelled to accept. The
councillors of the several Tokugawa clans were
very well aware that their sun had set, and
urged his appointment as of a man who was
personally popular with the other clans. But
Keiki perceived that the days of the Shogunate
were past. It is not improbable that he himself
perceived, as Ii Navsuke had done before, that
united Japan only would be able to maintain
its independence and such a Japan could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
exist under two heads. He offered repeatedly
to resign, but the Gosho had no liking for the
idea of leaving its repose. The majority of the
members clung to the ideas of Nijo. As to the
boy emperor, he had no more voice than his
father had had before him, or than Mori possessed
within Choshiu&#8217;s clan. In the regeneration
of Japan, no help could be expected from
Miya, Kuge, or Daimiyo, long since converted
into puppets by the very duality of the national
character. The men who undertook the work
were unknown nobodies; but it was exactly by
such men that the different clans had been ruled
separately, and by combining together they
could rule all the clans, that is Japan, collectively.</p>

<p>Strictly speaking, therefore, there was no
vital change in the affairs of Japan so long as
the government was nominally in the hands of
a figurehead, and in reality in those of the samurai.
In all these troubles, the people had no
share, nor did they take any interest in them,
except when their own personal interests were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
directly affected. In the eyes of the dominating
class the people had no existence; and
when, in the documents of those days the word
&#8220;people&#8221; is used, it refers solely to the samurai.</p>

<p>Although Aidzu was still in possession of
Kyoto, and in charge of the gates of the Gosho,
the half-hearted orders of Keiki permitted the
leaders of Satsuma and other clans to communicate
with their friends within the Council,
and once again the men who were for repose at
any cost felt the ground moving from under
their feet. They brought pressure to bear upon
the Shogun, and he once again offered his resignation.
It was accepted on the 9th of November,
1867, but upon condition that for the
present he should continue the administration.</p>

DOWN WITH TOKUGAWA!</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Great</span> events were expected when the
year 1868 dawned. Couriers arrived
daily at Nagato from Kyoto, and our
two friends, as well as the banished kuge were
in a fever of expectation. Ekichi had asked and
obtained furlough, and had left for Kyoto. He
was greatly attached to Inouye, and frequently
forestalled his wishes, but in a quiet, unobtrusive
way. He was, moreover, so sedate in his
habits, that there was no cause for watching
him. However much Ito and Inouye would
have done for him for the sake of his late
father, they felt that his future could be
safely left to himself.</p>

<p>The two friends had taken dinner together
on the 7th of January, when the galloping of a
horse was heard, and the animal stopped evidently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
in front of the yashiki. After a slight
delay, a servant appeared and announced Mr.
Kano. A moment later Ekichi entered, somewhat
flushed. They saluted, and Inouye who
observed him closely, said:</p>

<p>&#8220;You came on horseback and evidently had
a long journey. Have you had dinner?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir, I did not wish to loiter on the
road.&#8221;</p>

<p>A servant was ordered to serve dinner to the
guest. After he had finished, Inouye resumed:</p>

<p>&#8220;You bring important news, do you not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Satsuma, Tosa, and some other clans took
possession of the Gosho, four days ago, and
Arisugawa no Miya is guardian on His Majesty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Inouye clapped his hands. When his attendant
appeared, he told him to go to the castle,
and request the kuge to honor him with a call.
Ito, who had been charged with the command
of the army, rose and said: &#8220;Shall we march
in the morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; was the reply, &#8220;that will be best.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>The two friends had so often considered
what they would do when this time should arrive,
that no further consultation was necessary.
Ito went first to the most active Councillor,
and explained to him what had happened;
he then proceeded to the barracks, and gave
orders that the army was to march at six in the
morning. When he returned, he found the
kuge, highly pleased at the prospect of their
speedy return. They knew that, with Arisugawa
as adviser, Tenshi Sama would restore
them to honor, and Mori would be exculpated.
Indeed, at four o&#8217;clock in the morning a messenger
arrived bringing the official papers.</p>

<p>The two Councillors breakfasted with the
kuge. During the meal, Ito said:</p>

<p>&#8220;We must make hurried marches, gentlemen.
Tokugawa will not submit peaceably.
If our friends prevail, it means the ruin of the
Tokugawa men; hence I expect we shall have
trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>The army marched out, leaving only a sufficient
number of men to guard the territory of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
the clan. It was now that the difference between
samurai and an army on the march could
be best observed. The men stepped out evenly
in close ranks, and easily, and without apparent
fatigue performed a two days&#8217; journey. The
kuge were surprised. Ito and Inouye explained
what had been done, and the reason for
it. Whereas the daimiyo had never traveled
to Kyoto in less than seven days, the Choshiu
men arrived at their yashiki within four days
from the time they left Nagato.</p>

<p>The kuge were escorted to the Palace. Here
they found that an entirely new order prevailed.
The allied clans guarded the gates, but permitted
free ingress and egress to all samurai except
such as bore the Tokugawa crest. An imperial
decree had been issued abolishing the
office of Shogun, and declaring that the government
would be conducted by the imperial
court. Negotiations were being conducted
with Keiki to arrive at an equitable settlement.</p>

<p>Brought up as he had been as the son of
Mito, Keiki had always trusted to his councillors,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
and was quite as ignorant of affairs as
Mori. He has been accused of vacillation, but
personally he was not consulted at all. Answers,
of which he knew nothing, were given
in his name and under his seal. It was quite
natural that among his councillors there should
be two parties, the one advocating submission,
the other resistance. The answer depended
upon the majority among his councillors.</p>

<p>At last it was decided by his advisers that he
should leave Kyoto and withdraw to Osaka.
He was escorted by the two clans of Aidzu and
Kuwana, both intensely attached to the house
of Iyeyasu, and unspoiled. Their leaders urged,
and almost compelled Keiki to fight. Himself
possessed of patriotic impulses, he refused.</p>

<p>The new government at Kyoto dreaded war;
not from fear, but on account of the probable
consequences. Sanjo and Iwakura had been
reinstated and were often in conference with
Ito, Inouye, Goto, OKubo, and Saigo. It was
plainly evident that the government could not
be carried on without revenue, and the Court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
possessed nothing but a pittance allotted to it
from Tokugawa&#8217;s superfluity. If war should
follow, Tokugawa had resources, while the
court had none. Even at present the Court
depended entirely upon the generosity of the
clans which had been instrumental in effecting
the revolution.</p>

<p>But the ex-Shogun or his party had also very
good reasons for avoiding civil war. It was
they who would be Choteki this time, and every
Japanese has a horror of that word. Besides,
the Tokugawa clans were divided among themselves.
Echizen and Owari had openly declared
for Tenshi Sama, and had, in fact aided
in ousting Aidzu. There was thus every prospect
of peace, and the Court, to facilitate negotiations,
despatched the daimiyo of Echizen
and Owari, to offer the Tokugawa clan a fair
share in the government.</p>

<p>Keiki wished to accept; indeed, he was most
anxious to wash his hands of all interference
with politics, but Aidzu and Kuwana would not
have it. They expected to restore the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
order of things, and Keiki escorted by the two
clans, much against his will, set out upon the
return journey to Kyoto.</p>

<p>The army of the allied clans was small, being
almost completely composed of Satsuma and
Choshiu men. But these men were excellently
drilled, for Satsuma, too, had had a lesson from
the barbarians, and profited by it. The loyal
army, that is the army of the allied clans had
taken a strong position at Fushimi. The Yodo
river connects this town with Osaka, with a
good road on each bank. The Tokugawa forces
marched by both banks, and were received by
a well-directed artillery fire. The rice fields
prevented them from deploying and, as they
understood nothing but a hand to hand mêlee,
they had no chance in taking a strong strategic
position. Three days they attempted to carry
Fushimi and failed. Then they broke and fled,
pursued by the victorious imperialists.</p>

<p>Ekichi had commanded a battery in this battle,
and had again distinguished himself by his
calmness and steadiness under fire. When the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
battle was over, he went to his commanding
officer, and begged to be detailed for the pursuit.
His request was granted, and soon he
was among the foremost of the imperialists. It
was noticed that he did not use his sword, except
in self-defense. Half-way toward Osaka
the pursuers were commanded to halt.</p>

<p>The imperial forces were not strong enough
to cope with those of the Tokugawa, and orders
were sent to the loyal clans to send reinforcements.
From all parts of the South and West
samurai hurried to support the Tenshi Sama&#8217;s
cause and it was not long before the loyal army
set out in pursuit.</p>

<p>Keiki had escaped from Aidzu by departing
for Yedo on one of his steamships; upon his
arrival there he sent in his submission, but the
mountain clans would not obey his orders. It
is odd that he should not have taken his seal
with him; if these same orders had been issued
over his seal, there is no doubt that Aidzu and
Kuwana would have submitted. But personal
government had for centuries been unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
in Japan. If Mori, personally, should have
given an order to Choshiu, nobody would have
paid any attention to it; and if an order to exactly
the opposite effect had appeared over his
seal, it would have been obeyed at once.</p>

<p>We shall now return to our friends.</p>

<p>While the Choshiu forces, escorting the recalled
kuge were marching toward Kyoto, Ito
remained behind, quietly biding his time. After
the battle of Fushimi was fought and Keiki had
embarked for Yedo, the Tokugawa officials deserted
their posts and fled. Ito at once went to
the administration building, and declared himself
governor for his Majesty Tenshi Sama.
He took over the government, and prevented
lawlessness.</p>

<p>Kobe, a part of the beach in the immediate
vicinity of Hyogo had been opened to foreigners,
and Ito declared it his purpose to protect
them. The same policy had been adopted by
those who advised the young Emperor. Japan
was never in a worse position to defy a foreign
power and her leaders were aware of the fact.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
One and all they hated the barbarians, but they
loved their country more. They had roughly
outlined a policy which was to make of Japan a
united and great country, and that object they
lost never out of sight.</p>

<p>At Yedo the Aidzu clan made a stand at the
beautiful temple at Uyeno (Pron. Oo-way-no).
Here Ekichi was in the van. Both parties
fought with desperate courage, but Tokugawa
lost. Among the dead was Kano Ekichi, the
son of the dead leader.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XXII<br />
CONCLUSION</h2></div>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap">Thirty-seven</span> years have passed
since this story opened. It is in the
month of May, 1895, and two men
are sitting at a hibachi in an upper room in
Shinagawa, formerly a suburb of Yedo, now a
part of the city of Tokyo. The men were hale
and hearty, but their gray hair, bordering on
white, showed that they were beyond middle
age. Their hair was cut after our fashion, but
one wore a straggling beard, while the other&#8217;s
snow-white moustache showed off to advantage
his small mouth.</p>

<p>The room where they were sitting was at the
back of the second story of a house, which, apparently
at least was of our cottage style of
architecture. If one had pressed the electric
bell, and entered it, he would not have seen anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
except what might be expected in the
home of a well-to-do American or European.
He might have noticed the taste displayed by
the owner, and the quiet, unobtrusive elegance,
but it would not have caused him to suspect
that he was in the house of a Japanese.</p>

<p>The whole of the lower floor, except the
kitchen and servants&#8217; rooms, was such as one
might have expected in an opulent American or
English city. The upper story, however, retained
the native simplicity, save that walls, instead
of the light, airy sho ji, helped to support
the roof. The prospect from every side was
lovely, for the house stood on one of the bluffs,
bordering the former Tokaido. That highway
was there still, but its glory has departed.
Every hour, and sometimes more frequently,
trains run between Yokohama and Tokyo, and
thousands of passengers mingle daily in the
large waiting-rooms and in the depot at Shinbashi.
There the former daimiyo comes in
actual contact with the ninzoku, and the kuge
of old stands by the side of the merchant.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>The front of the house gives a view of the
bay, lovely at high tide but disagreeable when
the ebb exposes mud-banks extending three
miles from the shore. It will not be long before
the government will perceive the value of
this land, and the eyesore will disappear. If
Rome could have been built in a day, these
Japanese would have done it.</p>

<p>If Ito looks from the windows on the right,
toward Shinagawa, his eye must fall upon the
handsome residence of Mori, where the son of
his former lord now leads a life of quiet elegance.
He is well satisfied with it. When Ito,
now higher in rank than his former lord, calls
to pay his respects as he often does, the same
relation seems to exist as in former days. Again
Ito is the simple samurai, his lord the daimiyo,
and in both there is a secret longing for the
days that are past. But when they look about
them that longing ceases, and they are glad and
proud of what they see.</p>



<p>From the windows in the left, Ito looks upon
Tokyo, now grown into one of the world cities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
Has it changed in these thirty-seven years? To
be sure it has, but not oppressively. As we walk
through the streets where dwell the people,
we notice that they are wider and cleaner; but
the houses are still as they were before, although
there is evidence of greater prosperity.
In Ginza, the street of the large shops, we see a
mixture of the occident and orient, not altogether
pleasant; houses built in foreign style,
divided into Japanese rooms or Japanese houses
with imitation foreign stores. Still it is all
Japanese, that is, we can not, even for a moment,
lose sight of the fact that we are in Japan.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_228f.jpg" alt="BUT THE HOUSES ARE STILL AS THEY WERE BEFORE" /></div>
<p class="caption">&#8220;BUT THE HOUSES ARE STILL AS THEY WERE BEFORE.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it is within the former castle grounds
that a great change is noticeable; especially at
Sakura, near the spot where Ii Naosuke paid
with his head the hatred of Mito. Where his
yashiki stood is an elegantly built edifice of
brick, a girls&#8217; school, formerly the polytechnic,
and facing the moat are a number of villas. In
the first of these dwelt Sanjo during his life;
next to it is the house once occupied by Shimadzu,
the head of the Satsuma clan, and up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
hill is the palace of Arisugawa, now in mourning,
for its head died some months ago.</p>

<p>It is quite evident that two strong forces are
working in Japan. The leaders of the people
are sincere in their desire to conform more and
more to occidental ideals, whereas the people
are striving strenuously to return to their former
habits and customs in domestic life. Both
parties are impelled by the same motive, love of
country. But the leaders have more experience
and a wider horizon. They have been
abroad, and judge occidental life, with all its
virtues and vices by the results which they produced.
The people know nothing of foreigners,
except of such with whom they come into
contact, and they have no love for them.</p>

<p>Thus, as an old friend expressed it to me, all
our modern improvements such as tend toward
enhancing the nation&#8217;s greatness and wealth,
have been assimilated. Japan, to-day, could
no more do without railroads, than we could do
without them. It is the same with telegraph
and telephone and other inventions where steam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
or electricity are the motive. The army and
navy have been organized according to the
highest standards, and will keep pace with the
best of the world. Industries have been and are
being organized, and receive careful protection
from the government. But in the home life,
the Japanese have turned back.</p>

<p>&#8220;The luxury of your homes,&#8221; said my friend,
&#8220;tends toward enervating the race. We do not
need your furniture; it is expensive and inelegant.
We sleep upon our futon as well as you
do upon your spring mattress. In your clothing
you are the slaves of a thing you call fashion,
and every year or oftener you are called
upon to pay tribute to it. Who ever heard of
anything so foolish? Our clothing keeps us
cool in summer, and hot in winter. It is inexpensive,
becoming, and leaves our limbs to their
natural action; what more do we want? As to
your food, I acknowledge that a meat diet is
more strengthening than our usual bill of fare,
and most of us indulge in it once a day. But to
prepare dishes merely to tickle the palate, is both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
foolish and wicked. We want no waste. That is
the reason why I prefer dressing in haori, hakama,
and Kimono, and why I prefer to live in
a Japanese house. If I, or any other Japanese,
visit your country, we conform with your customs
and habits, because we do not wish to give
offense. When you come here, you bring your
customs and habits with you, and parade them
before us, regardless if you give offense or not.
I think in doing so, you act wrongly or at least
in bad taste.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You believe in doing at Rome as the Romans
do,&#8221; I said smiling. &#8220;But surely one
can not always do so. Excuse me, but most of
your dishes are absolutely repugnant to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does that prove, but that you are a
slave to your stomach. Do you remember when
we first met? It is a long time ago, but I shall
never forget it. The impression of that day is
still vivid within me. I had heard that a barbarian
had come to live in our next door yashiki,
and I wondered what sort of an animal he
was. My father had told me I must be very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
civil when I should see you, and, of course,
there was nothing for it but to mind. I had
come from school when I heard steps behind me
and then somebody grabbed me and I saw you.
It was well that I did not wear my swords at
that time, or we should not be talking here, and
Japan would have paid another indemnity.
You don&#8217;t know the fury you raised in me at
your unceremonious introduction. Well, you
dragged me in your yashiki, and placed bread,
butter and sugar before me. Do you remember
that, when your kadzukai came in, I asked
him what those things were, and what you
wanted me to do with them? He told me they
were bread, oil from the cow, (niku no abura),
and sugar, and were there for me to eat. Talk
of repugnant! It was nauseous to me to think
of such a thing as eating &#8216;oil from the cow.&#8217;
But when I am in America now, I enjoy my
butter and sometimes help myself twice.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be,&#8221; I replied, &#8220;but for the life
of me, I could not eat your raw fish, and many
other dishes.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>&#8220;Pshaw! It is on account of an imagination
which we call prejudice. You don&#8217;t possess
the nerve to try them, and if you did from
some reason, for instance false shame, they
would probably upset your stomach. You could
not turn my stomach in those days, child
though I was, but sometimes you tried me
pretty severely. When I came home that first
evening, I told my father all about you, and if
you had heard my description, I do not think
that you would have felt flattered. But he told
me to cultivate your acquaintance, and his
word was law.</p>

<p>&#8220;It took me sometime to grow accustomed
to&mdash;to&mdash;, well, I shall draw it mild, to your
lack of manners and of good breeding. But
then, as my father explained to me, you were
only a barbarian, and without any education;
and you were, or tried to be, kind; I appreciated
that. So you taught me English, and I
taught you Japanese, and you tested my self-control
by the funny mistakes you made. Let
me see how long is that ago? Twenty-six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
years? How long will it be before you can
speak Japanese, do you think?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, that is rather rough on me,&#8221; I
laughed. &#8220;I find I can get along very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes? I always did admire my fellow-countrymen.
They have now another claim to
my regard. I speak in Japanese with you for
the sake of old times; but, do you know that I
sometimes need all my equanimity to bear with
the way in which you murder our language.
Sometimes you use expressions as if I were
your superior in rank; that is all right and
proper; but when, a moment late, you hurl a
word at my head fit only for a coolie or a servant,
I admire the perfect control I have of my
temper. No!&#8221; he continued slowly and looking
thoughtfully at me, &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you will
ever learn Japanese.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am satisfied with what I know,&#8221; I replied,
&#8220;but if my use of your tongue shocks your ear,
I am willing to converse in English, and I
promise you that I shall not criticize either your
pronunciation or grammar.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>He bowed ceremoniously and replied: &#8220;No,
thank you! When I am in the United States,
or in England, I speak English and try to act
as regardless of the feelings of others as your
fellow Anglo-Saxons act. As soon as I begin
to think in English, it seems as if I forget that
I am a Japanese gentleman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have mastered our language better
than I have yours, then, for when I speak in
Japanese I can never bring myself to use those
elegant circumlocutions which we call by a name
which to us has an ugly sound.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time it was my friend&#8217;s turn to laugh.
&#8220;Do you remember when poor Kato first came
to see you? We were at our lessons, and he to
do you honor had spent a few days in learning
the phrases: &#8216;I have heard of your famous
name,&#8217; and &#8216;I am happy to see your face.&#8217; He
came in and recited those two sentences in very
fair English, I thought. I see you jumping up
yet. What a spitfire you were! Poor Kato!
He did not know what to make of it. You
roared: &#8216;Now, what is the use of talking that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
way? You never heard of my name, for it is
not famous, and you don&#8217;t care about my face
any more than I care about yours.&#8217; Kato&#8217;s stock
of English was exhausted, and he politely requested
me to come to his assistance. Well, I
had manners if you had not, so I told him that
you were overpowered at the honor of his call,
and that this was your manner to invite him to
make himself at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So that was the reason that fellow bored me
until eleven o&#8217;clock. I owe you one for that!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes? We paid you foreigners well in those
days, more than we could really afford, but
most of you were worth the money. Not on
account of the duties you performed, not always
satisfactorily but generally to the best of
your ability, but on account of the never failing
amusement you afforded us. At a time when
you thought yourself a fair Japanese scholar I
have heard you criticized right before you, and
you were as unconscious as a babe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think that you show by what
you say the real difference between you and our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
race. By your own confession, I showed you
kindness, and, my memory deceives me badly,
or you reciprocated to some extent my friendship
for you. Yet you could stand by and patiently
listen to an adverse criticism of one who
was your friend, and, instead of resenting it,
as I would have done in a similar case, you
could be amused by it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! but you forget. At that time you
were still an object of suspicion to us. Shimonoseki
and Kagoshima were recent recollections,
and we were eating humble-pie. It is
different now. We know your strength and
your weakness and we know also our own
strength, and we can magnanimously condescend
to treat you as our equals. At that time
the whole nation dissembled; we hated you and
every foreigner, although we treated you so as
to flatter your conceit. It does not raise a people
in its own eyes when it forces itself to discard,
even for a time, its national pride, and
pretend to honor those whom it despises and
hates. I tell you, my old friend, I am proud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
of my country and of my people. We passed
through a fiery ordeal, and came out purified.
But I acknowledge also that the fire has left
scars which only time can heal. We are growing
better, not worse. The fact that we two
still find pleasure in each other&#8217;s company
proves that we are better able to appreciate
each other&#8217;s good qualities, and that is a type of
the feeling of Japan toward foreign nations.&#8221;</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
